Child of the pure unclouded brow
    And dreaming eyes of wonder!
Though time be fleet, and I and thou
    Are half a life asunder,
Thy loving smile will surely hail
The love-gift of a fairy-tale.

I have not seen thy sunny face,
    Nor heard thy silver laughter;
No thought of me shall find a place
    In thy young lifeâs hereafterâ
Enough that now thou wilt not fail
To listen to my fairy-tale.

A tale begun in other days,
    When summer suns were glowingâ
A simple chime, that served to time
    The rhythm of oar rowingâ
Whose echoes live in memory yet,
Though envious years would say âforget.â

Come, hearken then, ere voice of dread.
    With bitter tidings laden,
Shall summon to unwelcome bed
    A melancholy maiden!
We are but older children, dear,
Who fret to find our bedtime near.

Without, the frost, the blinding snow.
    The storm-windâs moody madnessâ
Within, the firelightâs ruddy glow,
    And childhoodâs nest of gladness.
The magic words shall hold thee fast:
Thou shalt not heed the raving blast.

And though the shadow of a sigh
    May tremble through the story,
For âhappy summer daysâ gone by,
    And vanishâd summer gloryâ
It shall not touch with breath of bale
The pleasance of our fairy-tale.

CHAPTER I.
Looking-Glass house


One thing was certain, that the _white_ kitten had had nothing to do
with it:âit was the black kittenâs fault entirely. For the white kitten
had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of
an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it
_couldnât_ have had any hand in the mischief.

The way Dinah washed her childrenâs faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw
she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which
was lying quite still and trying to purrâno doubt feeling that it was
all meant for its good.

But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,
and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great
arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been
having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been
trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all
knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the
middle.

âOh, you wicked little thing!â cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and
giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.
âReally, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You _ought_,
Dinah, you know you ought!â she added, looking reproachfully at the old
cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manageâand then she
scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted
with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didnât get on
very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten,
and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee,
pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then
putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be
glad to help, if it might.

âDo you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?â Alice began. âYouâd have
guessed if youâd been up in the window with meâonly Dinah was making
you tidy, so you couldnât. I was watching the boys getting in sticks
for the bonfireâand it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so
cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, weâll
go and see the bonfire to-morrow.â Here Alice wound two or three turns
of the worsted round the kittenâs neck, just to see how it would look:
this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor,
and yards and yards of it got unwound again.

âDo you know, I was so angry, Kitty,â Alice went on as soon as they
were comfortably settled again, âwhen I saw all the mischief you had
been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out
into the snow! And youâd have deserved it, you little mischievous
darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now donât interrupt
me!â she went on, holding up one finger. âIâm going to tell you all
your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing
your face this morning. Now you canât deny it, Kitty: I heard you!
Whatâs that you say?â (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) âHer
paw went into your eye? Well, thatâs _your_ fault, for keeping your
eyes openâif youâd shut them tight up, it wouldnât have happened. Now
donât make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled
Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk
before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she
wasnât thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the
worsted while I wasnât looking!

âThatâs three faults, Kitty, and youâve not been punished for any of
them yet. You know Iâm saving up all your punishments for Wednesday
weekâSuppose they had saved up all _my_ punishments!â she went on,
talking more to herself than the kitten. âWhat _would_ they do at the
end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day
came. Orâlet me seeâsuppose each punishment was to be going without a
dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without
fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldnât mind _that_ much! Iâd far
rather go without them than eat them!

âDo you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and
soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over
outside. I wonder if the snow _loves_ the trees and fields, that it
kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with
a white quilt; and perhaps it says, âGo to sleep, darlings, till the
summer comes again.â And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they
dress themselves all in green, and dance aboutâwhenever the wind
blowsâoh, thatâs very pretty!â cried Alice, dropping the ball of
worsted to clap her hands. âAnd I do so _wish_ it was true! Iâm sure
the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.

âKitty, can you play chess? Now, donât smile, my dear, Iâm asking it
seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as
if you understood it: and when I said âCheck!â you purred! Well, it
_was_ a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadnât
been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces.
Kitty, dear, letâs pretendââ And here I wish I could tell you half the
things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase âLetâs
pretend.â She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the
day beforeâall because Alice had begun with âLetâs pretend weâre kings
and queens;â and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued
that they couldnât, because there were only two of them, and Alice had
been reduced at last to say, âWell, _you_ can be one of them then, and
_Iâll_ be all the rest.â And once she had really frightened her old
nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, âNurse! Do letâs pretend that
Iâm a hungry hyaena, and youâre a bone.â

But this is taking us away from Aliceâs speech to the kitten. âLetâs
pretend that youâre the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you
sat up and folded your arms, youâd look exactly like her. Now do try,
thereâs a dear!â And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
didnât succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldnât
fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the
Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it wasââand if youâre not
good directly,â she added, âIâll put you through into Looking-glass
House. How would you like _that_?â

âNow, if youâll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, Iâll tell you
all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, thereâs the room you can
see through the glassâthatâs just the same as our drawing room, only
the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a
chairâall but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could
see _that_ bit! I want so much to know whether theyâve a fire in the
winter: you never _can_ tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and
then smoke comes up in that room tooâbut that may be only pretence,
just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are
something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that,
because Iâve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold
up one in the other room.

âHow would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if
theyâd give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isnât good to
drinkâBut oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a
little _peep_ of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the
door of our drawing-room wide open: and itâs very like our passage as
far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond.
Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into
Looking-glass House! Iâm sure itâs got, oh! such beautiful things in
it! Letâs pretend thereâs a way of getting through into it, somehow,
Kitty. Letâs pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we
can get through. Why, itâs turning into a sort of mist now, I declare!
Itâll be easy enough to get throughââ She was up on the chimney-piece
while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And
certainly the glass _was_ beginning to melt away, just like a bright
silvery mist.

In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly
down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to
look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind. âSo I shall be as warm here as I was in
the old room,â thought Alice: âwarmer, in fact, because thereâll be no
one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun itâll be, when
they see me through the glass in here, and canât get at me!â

Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from
the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest
was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall
next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the
chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at
her.

âThey donât keep this room so tidy as the other,â Alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth
among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little âOh!â of
surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The
chessmen were walking about, two and two!

âHere are the Red King and the Red Queen,â Alice said (in a whisper,
for fear of frightening them), âand there are the White King and the
White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovelâand here are two castles
walking arm in armâI donât think they can hear me,â she went on, as she
put her head closer down, âand Iâm nearly sure they canât see me. I
feel somehow as if I were invisibleââ

Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.

âIt is the voice of my child!â the White Queen cried out as she rushed
past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the
cinders. âMy precious Lily! My imperial kitten!â and she began
scrambling wildly up the side of the fender.

âImperial fiddlestick!â said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been
hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a _little_ annoyed with the
Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.

Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen
and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do
nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had
recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who
was sitting sulkily among the ashes, âMind the volcano!â

âWhat volcano?â said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as
if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.

âBlewâmeâup,â panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.
âMind you come upâthe regular wayâdonât get blown up!â

Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,
till at last she said, âWhy, youâll be hours and hours getting to the
table, at that rate. Iâd far better help you, hadnât I?â But the King
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could
neither hear her nor see her.

So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly
than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightnât take his breath away:
but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well
dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.

She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face
as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible
hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but
his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder
and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let
him drop upon the floor.

âOh! _please_ donât make such faces, my dear!â she cried out, quite
forgetting that the King couldnât hear her. âYou make me laugh so that
I can hardly hold you! And donât keep your mouth so wide open! All the
ashes will get into itâthere, now I think youâre tidy enough!â she
added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the
Queen.

The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still:
and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the
room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she
could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it
she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together
in a frightened whisperâso low, that Alice could hardly hear what they
said.

The King was saying, âI assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very
ends of my whiskers!â

To which the Queen replied, âYou havenât got any whiskers.â

âThe horror of that moment,â the King went on, âI shall never, _never_
forget!â

âYou will, though,â the Queen said, âif you donât make a memorandum of
it.â

Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous
memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought
struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some
way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.

The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for
him, and at last he panted out, âMy dear! I really _must_ get a thinner
pencil. I canât manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things
that I donât intendââ

âWhat manner of things?â said the Queen, looking over the book (in
which Alice had put â_The White Knight is sliding down the poker. He
balances very badly_â) âThatâs not a memorandum of _your_ feelings!â

There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,
ââfor itâs all in some language I donât know,â she said to herself.

It was like this.

     ,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA

She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought
struck her. âWhy, itâs a Looking-glass book, of course! And if I hold
it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.â

This was the poem that Alice read.

JABBERWOCKY.

âTwas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe.

âBeware the Jabberwock, my son!
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
    The frumious Bandersnatch!â

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
    Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
    And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
    And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
    He went galumphing back.

âAnd hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!â
    He chortled in his joy.

âTwas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe.


âIt seems very pretty,â she said when she had finished it, âbut itâs
_rather_ hard to understand!â (You see she didnât like to confess, even
to herself, that she couldnât make it out at all.) âSomehow it seems to
fill my head with ideasâonly I donât exactly know what they are!
However, _somebody_ killed _something_: thatâs clear, at any rateââ

âBut oh!â thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, âif I donât make haste I
shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before Iâve seen what
the rest of the house is like! Letâs have a look at the garden first!â
She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairsâor, at least,
it wasnât exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down
stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the
tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without
even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the
hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if
she hadnât caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy
with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself
walking again in the natural way.




CHAPTER II.
The Garden of Live Flowers


âI should see the garden far better,â said Alice to herself, âif I
could get to the top of that hill: and hereâs a path that leads
straight to itâat least, no, it doesnât do thatââ (after going a few
yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), âbut I
suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! Itâs more like a
corkscrew than a path! Well, _this_ turn goes to the hill, I
supposeâno, it doesnât! This goes straight back to the house! Well
then, Iâll try it the other way.â

And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but
always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when
she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it
before she could stop herself.

âItâs no use talking about it,â Alice said, looking up at the house and
pretending it was arguing with her. âIâm _not_ going in again yet. I
know I should have to get through the Looking-glass againâback into the
old roomâand thereâd be an end of all my adventures!â

So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more
down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.
For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, âI really
_shall_ do it this timeââ when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.

âOh, itâs too bad!â she cried. âI never saw such a house for getting in
the way! Never!â

However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with
a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.

âO Tiger-lily,â said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, âI _wish_ you could talk!â

âWe _can_ talk,â said the Tiger-lily: âwhen thereâs anybody worth
talking to.â

Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voiceâalmost in a whisper.
âAnd can _all_ the flowers talk?â

âAs well as _you_ can,â said the Tiger-lily. âAnd a great deal louder.â

âIt isnât manners for us to begin, you know,â said the Rose, âand I
really was wondering when youâd speak! Said I to myself, âHer face has
got _some_ sense in it, though itâs not a clever one!â Still, youâre
the right colour, and that goes a long way.â

âI donât care about the colour,â the Tiger-lily remarked. âIf only her
petals curled up a little more, sheâd be all right.â

Alice didnât like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
âArenât you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take care of you?â

âThereâs the tree in the middle,â said the Rose: âwhat else is it good
for?â

âBut what could it do, if any danger came?â Alice asked.

âIt says âBough-wough!ââ cried a Daisy: âthatâs why its branches are
called boughs!â

âDidnât you know _that_?â cried another Daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. âSilence, every one of you!â cried the Tiger-lily, waving
itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement.
âThey know I canât get at them!â it panted, bending its quivering head
towards Alice, âor they wouldnât dare to do it!â

âNever mind!â Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, âIf you donât
hold your tongues, Iâll pick you!â

There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white.

âThatâs right!â said the Tiger-lily. âThe daisies are worst of all.
When one speaks, they all begin together, and itâs enough to make one
wither to hear the way they go on!â

âHow is it you can all talk so nicely?â Alice said, hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment. âIâve been in many gardens
before, but none of the flowers could talk.â

âPut your hand down, and feel the ground,â said the Tiger-lily. âThen
youâll know why.â

Alice did so. âItâs very hard,â she said, âbut I donât see what that
has to do with it.â

âIn most gardens,â the Tiger-lily said, âthey make the beds too softâso
that the flowers are always asleep.â

This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know
it. âI never thought of that before!â she said.

âItâs _my_ opinion that you never think _at all_,â the Rose said in a
rather severe tone.

âI never saw anybody that looked stupider,â a Violet said, so suddenly,
that Alice quite jumped; for it hadnât spoken before.

âHold _your_ tongue!â cried the Tiger-lily. âAs if _you_ ever saw
anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there,
till you know no more whatâs going on in the world, than if you were a
bud!â

âAre there any more people in the garden besides me?â Alice said, not
choosing to notice the Roseâs last remark.

âThereâs one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,â
said the Rose. âI wonder how you do itââ (âYouâre always wondering,â
said the Tiger-lily), âbut sheâs more bushy than you are.â

âIs she like me?â Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her
mind, âThereâs another little girl in the garden, somewhere!â

âWell, she has the same awkward shape as you,â the Rose said, âbut
sheâs redderâand her petals are shorter, I think.â

âHer petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,â the Tiger-lily
interrupted: ânot tumbled about anyhow, like yours.â

âBut thatâs not _your_ fault,â the Rose added kindly: âyouâre beginning
to fade, you knowâand then one canât help oneâs petals getting a little
untidy.â

Alice didnât like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she
asked âDoes she ever come out here?â

âI daresay youâll see her soon,â said the Rose. âSheâs one of the
thorny kind.â

âWhere does she wear the thorns?â Alice asked with some curiosity.

âWhy all round her head, of course,â the Rose replied. âI was wondering
_you_ hadnât got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.â

âSheâs coming!â cried the Larkspur. âI hear her footstep, thump, thump,
thump, along the gravel-walk!â

Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. âSheâs
grown a good deal!â was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches highâand
here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!

âItâs the fresh air that does it,â said the Rose: âwonderfully fine air
it is, out here.â

âI think Iâll go and meet her,â said Alice, for, though the flowers
were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have
a talk with a real Queen.

âYou canât possibly do that,â said the Rose: â_I_ should advise you to
walk the other way.â

This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.

A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.

It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at.

âWhere do you come from?â said the Red Queen. âAnd where are you going?
Look up, speak nicely, and donât twiddle your fingers all the time.â

Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she
could, that she had lost her way.

âI donât know what you mean by _your_ way,â said the Queen: âall the
ways about here belong to _me_âbut why did you come out here at all?â
she added in a kinder tone. âCurtsey while youâre thinking what to say,
it saves time.â

Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the
Queen to disbelieve it. âIâll try it when I go home,â she thought to
herself, âthe next time Iâm a little late for dinner.â

âItâs time for you to answer now,â the Queen said, looking at her
watch: âopen your mouth a _little_ wider when you speak, and always say
âyour Majesty.ââ

âI only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majestyââ

âThatâs right,â said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice
didnât like at all, âthough, when you say âgarden,ââ_Iâve_ seen
gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.â

Alice didnât dare to argue the point, but went on: ââand I thought Iâd
try and find my way to the top of that hillââ

âWhen you say âhill,ââ the Queen interrupted, â_I_ could show you
hills, in comparison with which youâd call that a valley.â

âNo, I shouldnât,â said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at
last: âa hill _canât_ be a valley, you know. That would be nonsenseââ

The Red Queen shook her head, âYou may call it ânonsenseâ if you like,â
she said, âbut _Iâve_ heard nonsense, compared with which that would be
as sensible as a dictionary!â

Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queenâs tone that she
was a _little_ offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.

For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all
directions over the countryâand a most curious country it was. There
were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from
side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a
number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.

âI declare itâs marked out just like a large chessboard!â Alice said at
last. âThere ought to be some men moving about somewhereâand so there
are!â She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick
with excitement as she went on. âItâs a great huge game of chess thatâs
being playedâall over the worldâif this _is_ the world at all, you
know. Oh, what fun it is! How I _wish_ I was one of them! I wouldnât
mind being a Pawn, if only I might joinâthough of course I should
_like_ to be a Queen, best.â

She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, âThatâs easily managed. You
can be the White Queenâs Pawn, if you like, as Lilyâs too young to
play; and youâre in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to
the Eighth Square youâll be a Queenââ Just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.

Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how
it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running
hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do
to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying âFaster! Faster!â
but Alice felt she _could not_ go faster, though she had not breath
left to say so.

The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they
went, they never seemed to pass anything. âI wonder if all the things
move along with us?â thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed
to guess her thoughts, for she cried, âFaster! Donât try to talk!â

Not that Alice had any idea of doing _that_. She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the Queen cried âFaster! Faster!â and dragged her along. âAre we
nearly there?â Alice managed to pant out at last.

âNearly there!â the Queen repeated. âWhy, we passed it ten minutes ago!
Faster!â And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling
in Aliceâs ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.

âNow! Now!â cried the Queen. âFaster! Faster!â And they went so fast
that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the
ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite
exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,
breathless and giddy.

The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, âYou may rest
a little now.â

Alice looked round her in great surprise. âWhy, I do believe weâve been
under this tree the whole time! Everythingâs just as it was!â

âOf course it is,â said the Queen, âwhat would you have it?â

âWell, in _our_ country,â said Alice, still panting a little, âyouâd
generally get to somewhere elseâif you ran very fast for a long time,
as weâve been doing.â

âA slow sort of country!â said the Queen. âNow, _here_, you see, it
takes all the running _you_ can do, to keep in the same place. If you
want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as
that!â

âIâd rather not try, please!â said Alice. âIâm quite content to stay
hereâonly I _am_ so hot and thirsty!â

âI know what _youâd_ like!â the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a
little box out of her pocket. âHave a biscuit?â

Alice thought it would not be civil to say âNo,â though it wasnât at
all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could:
and it was _very_ dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly
choked in all her life.

âWhile youâre refreshing yourself,â said the Queen, âIâll just take the
measurements.â And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in
inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in
here and there.

âAt the end of two yards,â she said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance, âI shall give you your directionsâhave another biscuit?â

âNo, thank you,â said Alice: âoneâs _quite_ enough!â

âThirst quenched, I hope?â said the Queen.

Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not
wait for an answer, but went on. âAt the end of _three_ yards I shall
repeat themâfor fear of your forgetting them. At the end of _four_, I
shall say good-bye. And at the end of _five_, I shall go!â

She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with
great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly
walking down the row.

At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, âA pawn goes two squares
in its first move, you know. So youâll go _very_ quickly through the
Third Squareâby railway, I should thinkâand youâll find yourself in the
Fourth Square in no time. Well, _that_ square belongs to Tweedledum and
Tweedledeeâthe Fifth is mostly waterâthe Sixth belongs to Humpty
DumptyâBut you make no remark?â

âIâI didnât know I had to make oneâjust then,â Alice faltered out.

âYou _should_ have said, âItâs extremely kind of you to tell me all
thisââhowever, weâll suppose it saidâthe Seventh Square is all
forestâhowever, one of the Knights will show you the wayâand in the
Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and itâs all feasting and
fun!â Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.

At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, âSpeak
in French when you canât think of the English for a thingâturn out your
toes as you walkâand remember who you are!â She did not wait for Alice
to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she
turned for a moment to say âgood-bye,â and then hurried on to the last.

How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last
peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she
ran quickly into the wood (âand she _can_ run very fast!â thought
Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began
to remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her
to move.




CHAPTER III.
Looking-Glass Insects


Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through. âItâs something very like
learning geography,â thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of
being able to see a little further. âPrincipal riversâthere _are_ none.
Principal mountainsâIâm on the only one, but I donât think itâs got any
name. Principal townsâwhy, what _are_ those creatures, making honey
down there? They canât be beesânobody ever saw bees a mile off, you
knowââ and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that
was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them,
âjust as if it was a regular bee,â thought Alice.

However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an
elephantâas Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath
away at first. âAnd what enormous flowers they must be!â was her next
idea. âSomething like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put
to themâand what quantities of honey they must make! I think Iâll go
down andâno, I wonât _just_ yet,â she went on, checking herself just as
she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse
for turning shy so suddenly. âItâll never do to go down among them
without a good long branch to brush them awayâand what fun itâll be
when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall sayââOh, I like it well
enoughâââ (here came the favourite little toss of the head), ââonly it
was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so!ââ

âI think Iâll go down the other way,â she said after a pause: âand
perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to
get into the Third Square!â

So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of
the six little brooks.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


âTickets, please!â said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the
same size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.

âNow then! Show your ticket, child!â the Guard went on, looking angrily
at Alice. And a great many voices all said together (âlike the chorus
of a song,â thought Alice), âDonât keep him waiting, child! Why, his
time is worth a thousand pounds a minute!â

âIâm afraid I havenât got one,â Alice said in a frightened tone: âthere
wasnât a ticket-office where I came from.â And again the chorus of
voices went on. âThere wasnât room for one where she came from. The
land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!â

âDonât make excuses,â said the Guard: âyou should have bought one from
the engine-driver.â And once more the chorus of voices went on with
âThe man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke alone is worth a
thousand pounds a puff!â

Alice thought to herself, âThen thereâs no use in speaking.â The voices
didnât join in this time, as she hadnât spoken, but to her great
surprise, they all _thought_ in chorus (I hope you understand what
_thinking in chorus_ meansâfor I must confess that _I_ donât), âBetter
say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!â

âI shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!â
thought Alice.

All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope,
then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he
said, âYouâre travelling the wrong way,â and shut up the window and
went away.

âSo young a child,â said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was
dressed in white paper), âought to know which way sheâs going, even if
she doesnât know her own name!â

A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyes
and said in a loud voice, âShe ought to know her way to the
ticket-office, even if she doesnât know her alphabet!â

There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer
carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be
that they should all speak in turn, _he_ went on with âSheâll have to
go back from here as luggage!â

Alice couldnât see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse
voice spoke next. âChange enginesââ it said, and was obliged to leave
off.

âIt sounds like a horse,â Alice thought to herself. And an extremely
small voice, close to her ear, said, âYou might make a joke on
thatâsomething about âhorseâ and âhoarse,â you know.â

Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, âShe must be labelled
âLass, with care,â you knowââ

And after that other voices went on (âWhat a number of people there are
in the carriage!â thought Alice), saying, âShe must go by post, as
sheâs got a head on herââ âShe must be sent as a message by the
telegraphââ âShe must draw the train herself the rest of the wayââ and
so on.

But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear, âNever mind what they all say, my dear, but take a
return-ticket every time the train stops.â

âIndeed I shanât!â Alice said rather impatiently. âI donât belong to
this railway journey at allâI was in a wood just nowâand I wish I could
get back there.â

âYou might make a joke on _that_,â said the little voice close to her
ear: âsomething about âyou _would_ if you could,â you know.â

âDonât tease so,â said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from; âif youâre so anxious to have a joke made, why donât
you make one yourself?â

The little voice sighed deeply: it was _very_ unhappy, evidently, and
Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, âIf it would
only sigh like other people!â she thought. But this was such a
wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldnât have heard it at all, if it
hadnât come _quite_ close to her ear. The consequence of this was that
it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the
unhappiness of the poor little creature.

âI know you are a friend,â the little voice went on; âa dear friend,
and an old friend. And you wonât hurt me, though I _am_ an insect.â

âWhat kind of insect?â Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she
really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she
thought this wouldnât be quite a civil question to ask.

âWhat, then you donâtââ the little voice began, when it was drowned by
a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm,
Alice among the rest.

The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in
and said, âItâs only a brook we have to jump over.â Everybody seemed
satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of
trains jumping at all. âHowever, itâll take us into the Fourth Square,
thatâs some comfort!â she said to herself. In another moment she felt
the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she
caught at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the
Goatâs beard.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found
herself sitting quietly under a treeâwhile the Gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just
over her head, and fanning her with its wings.

It certainly was a _very_ large Gnat: âabout the size of a chicken,â
Alice thought. Still, she couldnât feel nervous with it, after they had
been talking together so long.

ââthen you donât like all insects?â the Gnat went on, as quietly as if
nothing had happened.

âI like them when they can talk,â Alice said. âNone of them ever talk,
where _I_ come from.â

âWhat sort of insects do you rejoice in, where _you_ come from?â the
Gnat inquired.

âI donât _rejoice_ in insects at all,â Alice explained, âbecause Iâm
rather afraid of themâat least the large kinds. But I can tell you the
names of some of them.â

âOf course they answer to their names?â the Gnat remarked carelessly.

âI never knew them to do it.â

âWhatâs the use of their having names,â the Gnat said, âif they wonât
answer to them?â

âNo use to _them_,â said Alice; âbut itâs useful to the people who name
them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?â

âI canât say,â the Gnat replied. âFurther on, in the wood down there,
theyâve got no namesâhowever, go on with your list of insects: youâre
wasting time.â

âWell, thereâs the Horse-fly,â Alice began, counting off the names on
her fingers.

âAll right,â said the Gnat: âhalf way up that bush, youâll see a
Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. Itâs made entirely of wood, and gets
about by swinging itself from branch to branch.â

âWhat does it live on?â Alice asked, with great curiosity.

âSap and sawdust,â said the Gnat. âGo on with the list.â

Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made
up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright
and sticky; and then she went on.

âAnd thereâs the Dragon-fly.â

âLook on the branch above your head,â said the Gnat, âand there youâll
find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of
holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.â

âAnd what does it live on?â

âFrumenty and mince pie,â the Gnat replied; âand it makes its nest in a
Christmas box.â

âAnd then thereâs the Butterfly,â Alice went on, after she had taken a
good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to
herself, âI wonder if thatâs the reason insects are so fond of flying
into candlesâbecause they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!â

âCrawling at your feet,â said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in
some alarm), âyou may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin
slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump
of sugar.â

âAnd what does _it_ live on?â

âWeak tea with cream in it.â

A new difficulty came into Aliceâs head. âSupposing it couldnât find
any?â she suggested.

âThen it would die, of course.â

âBut that must happen very often,â Alice remarked thoughtfully.

âIt always happens,â said the Gnat.

After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat
amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it
settled again and remarked, âI suppose you donât want to lose your
name?â

âNo, indeed,â Alice said, a little anxiously.

âAnd yet I donât know,â the Gnat went on in a careless tone: âonly
think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without
it! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons,
she would call out âcome hereâ,â and there she would have to leave off,
because there wouldnât be any name for her to call, and of course you
wouldnât have to go, you know.â

âThat would never do, Iâm sure,â said Alice: âthe governess would never
think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldnât remember my
name, sheâd call me âMiss!â as the servants do.â

âWell, if she said âMiss,â and didnât say anything more,â the Gnat
remarked, âof course youâd miss your lessons. Thatâs a joke. I wish
_you_ had made it.â

âWhy do you wish _I_ had made it?â Alice asked. âItâs a very bad one.â

But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling
down its cheeks.

âYou shouldnât make jokes,â Alice said, âif it makes you so unhappy.â

Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the
poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice
looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as
she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and
walked on.

She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of
it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a _little_
timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her
mind to go on: âfor I certainly wonât go _back_,â she thought to
herself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.

âThis must be the wood,â she said thoughtfully to herself, âwhere
things have no names. I wonder whatâll become of _my_ name when I go
in? I shouldnât like to lose it at allâbecause theyâd have to give me
another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the
fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name!
Thatâs just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose
dogsââ_answers to the name of âDash:â had on a brass collar_ââjust
fancy calling everything you met âAlice,â till one of them answered!
Only they wouldnât answer at all, if they were wise.â

She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady. âWell, at any rate itâs a great comfort,â she said
as she stepped under the trees, âafter being so hot, to get into
theâinto _what_?â she went on, rather surprised at not being able to
think of the word. âI mean to get under theâunder theâunder _this_, you
know!â putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. âWhat _does_ it call
itself, I wonder? I do believe itâs got no nameâwhy, to be sure it
hasnât!â

She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again.
âThen it really _has_ happened, after all! And now, who am I? I _will_
remember, if I can! Iâm determined to do it!â But being determined
didnât help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of
puzzling, was, âL, I _know_ it begins with L!â

Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large
gentle eyes, but didnât seem at all frightened. âHere then! Here then!â
Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it
only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.

âWhat do you call yourself?â the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet
voice it had!

âI wish I knew!â thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly,
âNothing, just now.â

âThink again,â it said: âthat wonât do.â

Alice thought, but nothing came of it. âPlease, would you tell me what
_you_ call yourself?â she said timidly. âI think that might help a
little.â

âIâll tell you, if youâll move a little further on,â the Fawn said. âI
canât remember here.â

So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into
another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,
and shook itself free from Aliceâs arms. âIâm a Fawn!â it cried out in
a voice of delight, âand, dear me! youâre a human child!â A sudden look
of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it
had darted away at full speed.

Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at
having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. âHowever, I
know my name now.â she said, âthatâs _some_ comfort. AliceâAliceâI
wonât forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to
follow, I wonder?â

It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one
road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.
âIâll settle it,â Alice said to herself, âwhen the road divides and
they point different ways.â

But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way,
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked âTO TWEEDLEDUMâS HOUSEâ and the other
âTO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.â

âI do believe,â said Alice at last, âthat they live in the same house!
I wonder I never thought of that beforeâBut I canât stay there long.
Iâll just call and say âhow dâyou do?â and ask them the way out of the
wood. If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!â So
she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a
sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she
could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered
herself, feeling sure that they must be.




CHAPTER IV.
Tweedledum And Tweedledee


They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the otherâs
neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them
had âDUMâ embroidered on his collar, and the other âDEE.â âI suppose
theyâve each got âTWEEDLEâ round at the back of the collar,â she said
to herself.

They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was
just looking round to see if the word âTWEEDLEâ was written at the back
of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one
marked âDUM.â

âIf you think weâre wax-works,â he said, âyou ought to pay, you know.
Wax-works werenât made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!â

âContrariwise,â added the one marked âDEE,â âif you think weâre alive,
you ought to speak.â

âIâm sure Iâm very sorry,â was all Alice could say; for the words of
the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock,
and she could hardly help saying them out loud:â

âTweedledum and Tweedledee
    Agreed to have a battle;
For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
    Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
    As black as a tar-barrel;
Which frightened both the heroes so,
    They quite forgot their quarrel.â


âI know what youâre thinking about,â said Tweedledum: âbut it isnât so,
nohow.â

âContrariwise,â continued Tweedledee, âif it was so, it might be; and
if it were so, it would be; but as it isnât, it ainât. Thatâs logic.â

âI was thinking,â Alice said very politely, âwhich is the best way out
of this wood: itâs getting so dark. Would you tell me, please?â

But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.

They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice
couldnât help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying âFirst
Boy!â

âNohow!â Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with
a snap.

âNext Boy!â said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out âContrariwise!â and so he did.

âYouâve been wrong!â cried Tweedledum. âThe first thing in a visit is
to say âHow dâye do?â and shake hands!â And here the two brothers gave
each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free,
to shake hands with her.

Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of
hurting the other oneâs feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered
afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was
done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one
across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.

âBut it certainly _was_ funny,â (Alice said afterwards, when she was
telling her sister the history of all this,) âto find myself singing
â_Here we go round the mulberry bush_.â I donât know when I began it,
but somehow I felt as if Iâd been singing it a long long time!â

The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. âFour
times round is enough for one dance,â Tweedledum panted out, and they
left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at
the same moment.

Then they let go of Aliceâs hands, and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didnât know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. âIt
would never do to say âHow dâye do?â _now_,â she said to herself: âwe
seem to have got beyond that, somehow!â

âI hope youâre not much tired?â she said at last.

âNohow. And thank you _very_ much for asking,â said Tweedledum.

âSo _much_ obliged!â added Tweedledee. âYou like poetry?â

âYe-es, pretty wellâ_some_ poetry,â Alice said doubtfully. âWould you
tell me which road leads out of the wood?â

âWhat shall I repeat to her?â said Tweedledee, looking round at
Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Aliceâs question.

ââ_The Walrus and the Carpenter_â is the longest,â Tweedledum replied,
giving his brother an affectionate hug.

Tweedledee began instantly:

âThe sun was shiningââ


Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. âIf itâs _very_ long,â she said,
as politely as she could, âwould you please tell me first which roadââ

Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:

âThe sun was shining on the sea,
    Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
    The billows smooth and brightâ
And this was odd, because it was
    The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
    Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
    After the day was doneâ
âItâs very rude of him,â she said,
    âTo come and spoil the fun!â

The sea was wet as wet could be,
    The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
    No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying over headâ
    There were no birds to fly.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
    Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
    Such quantities of sand:
âIf this were only cleared away,â
    They said, âit _would_ be grand!â

âIf seven maids with seven mops
    Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,â the Walrus said,
    âThat they could get it clear?â
âI doubt it,â said the Carpenter,
    And shed a bitter tear.

âO Oysters, come and walk with us!â
    The Walrus did beseech.
âA pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
    Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
    To give a hand to each.â

The eldest Oyster looked at him.
    But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
    And shook his heavy headâ
Meaning to say he did not choose
    To leave the oyster-bed.

But four young oysters hurried up,
    All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
    Their shoes were clean and neatâ
And this was odd, because, you know,
    They hadnât any feet.

Four other Oysters followed them,
    And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
    And more, and more, and moreâ
All hopping through the frothy waves,
    And scrambling to the shore.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
    Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
    Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
    And waited in a row.

âThe time has come,â the Walrus said,
    âTo talk of many things:
Of shoesâand shipsâand sealing-waxâ
    Of cabbagesâand kingsâ
And why the sea is boiling hotâ
    And whether pigs have wings.â

âBut wait a bit,â the Oysters cried,
    âBefore we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
    And all of us are fat!â
âNo hurry!â said the Carpenter.
    They thanked him much for that.

âA loaf of bread,â the Walrus said,
    âIs what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
    Are very good indeedâ
Now if youâre ready Oysters dear,
    We can begin to feed.â

âBut not on us!â the Oysters cried,
    Turning a little blue,
âAfter such kindness, that would be
    A dismal thing to do!â
âThe night is fine,â the Walrus said
    âDo you admire the view?

âIt was so kind of you to come!
    And you are very nice!â
The Carpenter said nothing but
    âCut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deafâ
    Iâve had to ask you twice!â

âIt seems a shame,â the Walrus said,
    âTo play them such a trick,
After weâve brought them out so far,
    And made them trot so quick!â
The Carpenter said nothing but
    âThe butterâs spread too thick!â

âI weep for you,â the Walrus said.
    âI deeply sympathize.â
With sobs and tears he sorted out
    Those of the largest size.
Holding his pocket handkerchief
    Before his streaming eyes.

âO Oysters,â said the Carpenter.
    âYouâve had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?â
    But answer came there noneâ
And that was scarcely odd, because
    Theyâd eaten every one.â


âI like the Walrus best,â said Alice: âbecause you see he was a
_little_ sorry for the poor oysters.â

âHe ate more than the Carpenter, though,â said Tweedledee. âYou see he
held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldnât count
how many he took: contrariwise.â

âThat was mean!â Alice said indignantly. âThen I like the Carpenter
bestâif he didnât eat so many as the Walrus.â

âBut he ate as many as he could get,â said Tweedledum.

This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, âWell! They were _both_
very unpleasant charactersââ Here she checked herself in some alarm, at
hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more
likely to be a wild beast. âAre there any lions or tigers about here?â
she asked timidly.

âItâs only the Red King snoring,â said Tweedledee.

âCome and look at him!â the brothers cried, and they each took one of
Aliceâs hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.

âIsnât he a _lovely_ sight?â said Tweedledum.

Alice couldnât say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap
on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy
heap, and snoring loudââfit to snore his head off!â as Tweedledum
remarked.

âIâm afraid heâll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,â said Alice,
who was a very thoughtful little girl.

âHeâs dreaming now,â said Tweedledee: âand what do you think heâs
dreaming about?â

Alice said âNobody can guess that.â

âWhy, about _you_!â Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands
triumphantly. âAnd if he left off dreaming about you, where do you
suppose youâd be?â

âWhere I am now, of course,â said Alice.

âNot you!â Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. âYouâd be nowhere. Why,
youâre only a sort of thing in his dream!â

âIf that there King was to wake,â added Tweedledum, âyouâd go
outâbang!âjust like a candle!â

âI shouldnât!â Alice exclaimed indignantly. âBesides, if _Iâm_ only a
sort of thing in his dream, what are _you_, I should like to know?â

âDittoâ said Tweedledum.

âDitto, dittoâ cried Tweedledee.

He shouted this so loud that Alice couldnât help saying, âHush! Youâll
be waking him, Iâm afraid, if you make so much noise.â

âWell, it no use _your_ talking about waking him,â said Tweedledum,
âwhen youâre only one of the things in his dream. You know very well
youâre not real.â

âI _am_ real!â said Alice and began to cry.

âYou wonât make yourself a bit realler by crying,â Tweedledee remarked:
âthereâs nothing to cry about.â

âIf I wasnât real,â Alice saidâhalf-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculousââI shouldnât be able to cry.â

âI hope you donât suppose those are real tears?â Tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt.

âI know theyâre talking nonsense,â Alice thought to herself: âand itâs
foolish to cry about it.â So she brushed away her tears, and went on as
cheerfully as she could. âAt any rate Iâd better be getting out of the
wood, for really itâs coming on very dark. Do you think itâs going to
rain?â

Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and
looked up into it. âNo, I donât think it is,â he said: âat leastânot
under _here_. Nohow.â

âBut it may rain _outside_?â

âIt mayâif it chooses,â said Tweedledee: âweâve no objection.
Contrariwise.â

âSelfish things!â thought Alice, and she was just going to say
âGood-nightâ and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist.

âDo you see _that_?â he said, in a voice choking with passion, and his
eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a
trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.

âItâs only a rattle,â Alice said, after a careful examination of the
little white thing. âNot a rattle-_snake_, you know,â she added
hastily, thinking that he was frightened: âonly an old rattleâquite old
and broken.â

âI knew it was!â cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair. âItâs spoilt, of course!â Here he looked at Tweedledee,
who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella.

Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, âYou
neednât be so angry about an old rattle.â

âBut it isnât old!â Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever.
âItâs new, I tell youâI bought it yesterdayâmy nice new RATTLE!â and
his voice rose to a perfect scream.

All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that
it quite took off Aliceâs attention from the angry brother. But he
couldnât quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in
the umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and
shutting his mouth and his large eyesââlooking more like a fish than
anything else,â Alice thought.

âOf course you agree to have a battle?â Tweedledum said in a calmer
tone.

âI suppose so,â the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the
umbrella: âonly _she_ must help us to dress up, you know.â

So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned
in a minute with their arms full of thingsâsuch as bolsters, blankets,
hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. âI hope
youâre a good hand at pinning and tying strings?â Tweedledum remarked.
âEvery one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.â

Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about
anything in all her lifeâthe way those two bustled aboutâand the
quantity of things they put onâand the trouble they gave her in tying
strings and fastening buttonsââReally theyâll be more like bundles of
old clothes than anything else, by the time theyâre ready!â she said to
herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, âto
keep his head from being cut off,â as he said.

âYou know,â he added very gravely, âitâs one of the most serious things
that can possibly happen to one in a battleâto get oneâs head cut off.â

Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear
of hurting his feelings.

âDo I look very pale?â said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet
tied on. (He _called_ it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan.)

âWellâyesâa _little_,â Alice replied gently.

âIâm very brave generally,â he went on in a low voice: âonly to-day I
happen to have a headache.â

âAnd _Iâve_ got a toothache!â said Tweedledee, who had overheard the
remark. âIâm far worse off than you!â

âThen youâd better not fight to-day,â said Alice, thinking it a good
opportunity to make peace.

âWe _must_ have a bit of a fight, but I donât care about going on
long,â said Tweedledum. âWhatâs the time now?â

Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said âHalf-past four.â

âLetâs fight till six, and then have dinner,â said Tweedledum.

âVery well,â the other said, rather sadly: âand _she_ can watch usâonly
youâd better not come _very_ close,â he added: âI generally hit
everything I can seeâwhen I get really excited.â

âAnd _I_ hit everything within reach,â cried Tweedledum, âwhether I can
see it or not!â

Alice laughed. âYou must hit the _trees_ pretty often, I should think,â
she said.

Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. âI donât suppose,â
he said, âthereâll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by
the time weâve finished!â

âAnd all about a rattle!â said Alice, still hoping to make them a
_little_ ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.

âI shouldnât have minded it so much,â said Tweedledum, âif it hadnât
been a new one.â

âI wish the monstrous crow would come!â thought Alice.

âThereâs only one sword, you know,â Tweedledum said to his brother:
âbut you can have the umbrellaâitâs quite as sharp. Only we must begin
quick. Itâs getting as dark as it can.â

âAnd darker,â said Tweedledee.

It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on. âWhat a thick black cloud that is!â she said.
âAnd how fast it comes! Why, I do believe itâs got wings!â

âItâs the crow!â Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and
the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.

Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.
âIt can never get at me _here_,â she thought: âitâs far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldnât flap its
wings soâit makes quite a hurricane in the woodâhereâs somebodyâs shawl
being blown away!â




CHAPTER V.
Wool and Water


She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood,
with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice
very civilly went to meet her with the shawl.

âIâm very glad I happened to be in the way,â Alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again.

The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of
way, and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded
like âbread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,â and Alice felt that if there
was to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she
began rather timidly: âAm I addressing the White Queen?â

âWell, yes, if you call that a-dressing,â The Queen said. âIt isnât
_my_ notion of the thing, at all.â

Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, âIf your
Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, Iâll do it as well as
I can.â

âBut I donât want it done at all!â groaned the poor Queen. âIâve been
a-dressing myself for the last two hours.â

It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had
got some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. âEvery
single thingâs crooked,â Alice thought to herself, âand sheâs all over
pins!âmay I put your shawl straight for you?â she added aloud.

âI donât know whatâs the matter with it!â the Queen said, in a
melancholy voice. âItâs out of temper, I think. Iâve pinned it here,
and Iâve pinned it there, but thereâs no pleasing it!â

âIt _canât_ go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,â
Alice said, as she gently put it right for her; âand, dear me, what a
state your hair is in!â

âThe brush has got entangled in it!â the Queen said with a sigh. âAnd I
lost the comb yesterday.â

Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair
into order. âCome, you look rather better now!â she said, after
altering most of the pins. âBut really you should have a ladyâs maid!â

âIâm sure Iâll take you with pleasure!â the Queen said. âTwopence a
week, and jam every other day.â

Alice couldnât help laughing, as she said, âI donât want you to hire
_me_âand I donât care for jam.â

âItâs very good jam,â said the Queen.

âWell, I donât want any _to-day_, at any rate.â

âYou couldnât have it if you _did_ want it,â the Queen said. âThe rule
is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterdayâbut never jam to-day.â

âIt _must_ come sometimes to âjam to-day,ââ Alice objected.

âNo, it canât,â said the Queen. âItâs jam every _other_ day: to-day
isnât any _other_ day, you know.â

âI donât understand you,â said Alice. âItâs dreadfully confusing!â

âThatâs the effect of living backwards,â the Queen said kindly: âit
always makes one a little giddy at firstââ

âLiving backwards!â Alice repeated in great astonishment. âI never
heard of such a thing!â

ââbut thereâs one great advantage in it, that oneâs memory works both
ways.â

âIâm sure _mine_ only works one way,â Alice remarked. âI canât remember
things before they happen.â

âItâs a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,â the Queen
remarked.

âWhat sort of things do _you_ remember best?â Alice ventured to ask.

âOh, things that happened the week after next,â the Queen replied in a
careless tone. âFor instance, now,â she went on, sticking a large piece
of plaster on her finger as she spoke, âthereâs the Kingâs Messenger.
Heâs in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesnât even begin
till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.â

âSuppose he never commits the crime?â said Alice.

âThat would be all the better, wouldnât it?â the Queen said, as she
bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.

Alice felt there was no denying _that_. âOf course it would be all the
better,â she said: âbut it wouldnât be all the better his being
punished.â

âYouâre wrong _there_, at any rate,â said the Queen: âwere _you_ ever
punished?â

âOnly for faults,â said Alice.

âAnd you were all the better for it, I know!â the Queen said
triumphantly.

âYes, but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for,â said Alice:
âthat makes all the difference.â

âBut if you _hadnât_ done them,â the Queen said, âthat would have been
better still; better, and better, and better!â Her voice went higher
with each âbetter,â till it got quite to a squeak at last.

Alice was just beginning to say âThereâs a mistake somewhereâ,â when
the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence
unfinished. âOh, oh, oh!â shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as
if she wanted to shake it off. âMy fingerâs bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!â

Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that
Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.

âWhat _is_ the matter?â she said, as soon as there was a chance of
making herself heard. âHave you pricked your finger?â

âI havenât pricked it _yet_,â the Queen said, âbut I soon shallâoh, oh,
oh!â

âWhen do you expect to do it?â Alice asked, feeling very much inclined
to laugh.

âWhen I fasten my shawl again,â the poor Queen groaned out: âthe brooch
will come undone directly. Oh, oh!â As she said the words the brooch
flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it
again.

âTake care!â cried Alice. âYouâre holding it all crooked!â And she
caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the
Queen had pricked her finger.

âThat accounts for the bleeding, you see,â she said to Alice with a
smile. âNow you understand the way things happen here.â

âBut why donât you scream now?â Alice asked, holding her hands ready to
put over her ears again.

âWhy, Iâve done all the screaming already,â said the Queen. âWhat would
be the good of having it all over again?â

By this time it was getting light. âThe crow must have flown away, I
think,â said Alice: âIâm so glad itâs gone. I thought it was the night
coming on.â

âI wish _I_ could manage to be glad!â the Queen said. âOnly I never can
remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and
being glad whenever you like!â

âOnly it is so _very_ lonely here!â Alice said in a melancholy voice;
and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down
her cheeks.

âOh, donât go on like that!â cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands
in despair. âConsider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long
way youâve come to-day. Consider what oâclock it is. Consider anything,
only donât cry!â

Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.
âCan _you_ keep from crying by considering things?â she asked.

âThatâs the way itâs done,â the Queen said with great decision: ânobody
can do two things at once, you know. Letâs consider your age to begin
withâhow old are you?â

âIâm seven and a half exactly.â

âYou neednât say âexactually,ââ the Queen remarked: âI can believe it
without that. Now Iâll give _you_ something to believe. Iâm just one
hundred and one, five months and a day.â

âI canât believe _that_!â said Alice.

âCanât you?â the Queen said in a pitying tone. âTry again: draw a long
breath, and shut your eyes.â

Alice laughed. âThereâs no use trying,â she said: âone _canât_ believe
impossible things.â

âI daresay you havenât had much practice,â said the Queen. âWhen I was
your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes Iâve
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes
the shawl again!â

The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew
the Queenâs shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms
again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in
catching it for herself. âIâve got it!â she cried in a triumphant tone.
âNow you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!â

âThen I hope your finger is better now?â Alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the Queen.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


âOh, much better!â cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on. âMuch be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!â The last
word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.

She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldnât make out
what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that reallyâwas it
really a _sheep_ that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub
as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little
dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her
was an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and
then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.

âWhat is it you want to buy?â the Sheep said at last, looking up for a
moment from her knitting.

âI donât _quite_ know yet,â Alice said, very gently. âI should like to
look all round me first, if I might.â

âYou may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,â said
the Sheep: âbut you canât look _all_ round youâunless youâve got eyes
at the back of your head.â

But these, as it happened, Alice had _not_ got: so she contented
herself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.

The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious thingsâbut the
oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,
to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always
quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they
could hold.

âThings flow about so here!â she said at last in a plaintive tone,
after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright
thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box,
and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. âAnd
this one is the most provoking of allâbut Iâll tell you whatââ she
added, as a sudden thought struck her, âIâll follow it up to the very
top shelf of all. Itâll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!â

But even this plan failed: the âthingâ went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.

âAre you a child or a teetotum?â the Sheep said, as she took up another
pair of needles. âYouâll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round
like that.â She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice
couldnât help looking at her in great astonishment.

âHow _can_ she knit with so many?â the puzzled child thought to
herself. âShe gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!â

âCan you row?â the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke.

âYes, a littleâbut not on landâand not with needlesââ Alice was
beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between
banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.

âFeather!â cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.

This didnât sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said
nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the
water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and
would hardly come out again.

âFeather! Feather!â the Sheep cried again, taking more needles. âYouâll
be catching a crab directly.â

âA dear little crab!â thought Alice. âI should like that.â

âDidnât you hear me say âFeatherâ?â the Sheep cried angrily, taking up
quite a bunch of needles.

âIndeed I did,â said Alice: âyouâve said it very oftenâand very loud.
Please, where _are_ the crabs?â

âIn the water, of course!â said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles
into her hair, as her hands were full. âFeather, I say!â

â_Why_ do you say âfeatherâ so often?â Alice asked at last, rather
vexed. âIâm not a bird!â

âYou are,â said the Sheep: âyouâre a little goose.â

This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),
and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads.

âOh, please! There are some scented rushes!â Alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight. âThere really areâand _such_ beauties!â

âYou neednât say âpleaseâ to _me_ about âem,â the Sheep said, without
looking up from her knitting: âI didnât put âem there, and Iâm not
going to take âem away.â

âNo, but I meantâplease, may we wait and pick some?â Alice pleaded. âIf
you donât mind stopping the boat for a minute.â

âHow am _I_ to stop it?â said the Sheep. âIf you leave off rowing,
itâll stop of itself.â

So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in
elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them
offâand for a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting,
as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her
tangled hair dipping into the waterâwhile with bright eager eyes she
caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.

âI only hope the boat wonât tipple over!â she said to herself. âOh,
_what_ a lovely one! Only I couldnât quite reach it.â And it certainly
_did_ seem a little provoking (âalmost as if it happened on purpose,â
she thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful
rushes as the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that
she couldnât reach.

âThe prettiest are always further!â she said at last, with a sigh at
the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed
cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place,
and began to arrange her new-found treasures.

What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade,
and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she
picked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very
little whileâand these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like
snow, as they lay in heaps at her feetâbut Alice hardly noticed this,
there were so many other curious things to think about.

They hadnât gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and _wouldnât_ come out again (so Alice explained it
afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of âOh, oh,
oh!â from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down
among the heap of rushes.

However, she wasnât hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with
her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. âThat was
a nice crab you caught!â she remarked, as Alice got back into her
place, very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.

âWas it? I didnât see it,â Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water. âI wish it hadnât let goâI should so
like to see a little crab to take home with me!â But the Sheep only
laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.

âAre there many crabs here?â said Alice.

âCrabs, and all sorts of things,â said the Sheep: âplenty of choice,
only make up your mind. Now, what _do_ you want to buy?â

âTo buy!â Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightenedâfor the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all
in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.

âI should like to buy an egg, please,â she said timidly. âHow do you
sell them?â

âFivepence farthing for oneâTwopence for two,â the Sheep replied.

âThen two are cheaper than one?â Alice said in a surprised tone, taking
out her purse.

âOnly you _must_ eat them both, if you buy two,â said the Sheep.

âThen Iâll have _one_, please,â said Alice, as she put the money down
on the counter. For she thought to herself, âThey mightnât be at all
nice, you know.â

The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said âI
never put things into peopleâs handsâthat would never doâyou must get
it for yourself.â And so saying, she went off to the other end of the
shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.

âI wonder _why_ it wouldnât do?â thought Alice, as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the
end. âThe egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let
me see, is this a chair? Why, itâs got branches, I declare! How very
odd to find trees growing here! And actually hereâs a little brook!
Well, this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!â

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything
turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected
the egg to do the same.




CHAPTER VI.
Humpty Dumpty


However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human:
when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes
and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw
clearly that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. âIt canât be anybody else!â
she said to herself. âIâm as certain of it, as if his name were written
all over his face.â

It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous
face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on
the top of a high wallâsuch a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how
he could keep his balanceâand, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction, and he didnât take the least notice of her, she
thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.

âAnd how exactly like an egg he is!â she said aloud, standing with her
hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to
fall.

âItâs _very_ provoking,â Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence,
looking away from Alice as he spoke, âto be called an eggâ_Very!_â

âI said you _looked_ like an egg, Sir,â Alice gently explained. âAnd
some eggs are very pretty, you knowâ she added, hoping to turn her
remark into a sort of a compliment.

âSome people,â said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual,
âhave no more sense than a baby!â

Alice didnât know what to say to this: it wasnât at all like
conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to _her_; in fact,
his last remark was evidently addressed to a treeâso she stood and
softly repeated to herself:â

âHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the Kingâs horses and all the Kingâs men
Couldnât put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.â


âThat last line is much too long for the poetry,â she added, almost out
loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.

âDonât stand there chattering to yourself like that,â Humpty Dumpty
said, looking at her for the first time, âbut tell me your name and
your business.â

âMy _name_ is Alice, butââ

âItâs a stupid enough name!â Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently.
âWhat does it mean?â

â_Must_ a name mean something?â Alice asked doubtfully.

âOf course it must,â Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: â_my_ name
means the shape I amâand a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name
like yours, you might be any shape, almost.â

âWhy do you sit out here all alone?â said Alice, not wishing to begin
an argument.

âWhy, because thereâs nobody with me!â cried Humpty Dumpty. âDid you
think I didnât know the answer to _that_? Ask another.â

âDonât you think youâd be safer down on the ground?â Alice went on, not
with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature. âThat wall is so _very_ narrow!â

âWhat tremendously easy riddles you ask!â Humpty Dumpty growled out.
âOf course I donât think so! Why, if ever I _did_ fall offâwhich
thereâs no chance ofâbut _if_ I didââ Here he pursed his lips and
looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. â_If_
I did fall,â he went on, â_The King has promised meâwith his very own
mouth_âtoâtoââ

âTo send all his horses and all his men,â Alice interrupted, rather
unwisely.

âNow I declare thatâs too bad!â Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a
sudden passion. âYouâve been listening at doorsâand behind treesâand
down chimneysâor you couldnât have known it!â

âI havenât, indeed!â Alice said very gently. âItâs in a book.â

âAh, well! They may write such things in a _book_,â Humpty Dumpty said
in a calmer tone. âThatâs what you call a History of England, that is.
Now, take a good look at me! Iâm one that has spoken to a King, _I_ am:
mayhap youâll never see such another: and to show you Iâm not proud,
you may shake hands with me!â And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as
he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing
so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as
she took it. âIf he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet
behind,â she thought: âand then I donât know what would happen to his
head! Iâm afraid it would come off!â

âYes, all his horses and all his men,â Humpty Dumpty went on. âTheyâd
pick me up again in a minute, _they_ would! However, this conversation
is going on a little too fast: letâs go back to the last remark but
one.â

âIâm afraid I canât quite remember it,â Alice said very politely.

âIn that case we start fresh,â said Humpty Dumpty, âand itâs my turn to
choose a subjectââ (âHe talks about it just as if it was a game!â
thought Alice.) âSo hereâs a question for you. How old did you say you
were?â

Alice made a short calculation, and said âSeven years and six months.â

âWrong!â Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. âYou never said a word
like it!â

âI though you meant âHow old _are_ you?ââ Alice explained.

âIf Iâd meant that, Iâd have said it,â said Humpty Dumpty.

Alice didnât want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.

âSeven years and six months!â Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully. âAn
uncomfortable sort of age. Now if youâd asked _my_ advice, Iâd have
said âLeave off at sevenââbut itâs too late now.â

âI never ask advice about growing,â Alice said indignantly.

âToo proud?â the other inquired.

Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. âI mean,â she said,
âthat one canât help growing older.â

â_One_ canât, perhaps,â said Humpty Dumpty, âbut _two_ can. With proper
assistance, you might have left off at seven.â

âWhat a beautiful belt youâve got on!â Alice suddenly remarked.

(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if
they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn
now.) âAt least,â she corrected herself on second thoughts, âa
beautiful cravat, I should have saidâno, a belt, I meanâI beg your
pardon!â she added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly
offended, and she began to wish she hadnât chosen that subject. âIf I
only knew,â she thought to herself, âwhich was neck and which was
waist!â

Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two. When he _did_ speak again, it was in a deep growl.

âIt is aâ_mostâprovoking_âthing,â he said at last, âwhen a person
doesnât know a cravat from a belt!â

âI know itâs very ignorant of me,â Alice said, in so humble a tone that
Humpty Dumpty relented.

âItâs a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. Itâs a present
from the White King and Queen. There now!â

âIs it really?â said Alice, quite pleased to find that she _had_ chosen
a good subject, after all.

âThey gave it me,â Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, âthey gave it
meâfor an un-birthday present.â

âI beg your pardon?â Alice said with a puzzled air.

âIâm not offended,â said Humpty Dumpty.

âI mean, what _is_ an un-birthday present?â

âA present given when it isnât your birthday, of course.â

Alice considered a little. âI like birthday presents best,â she said at
last.

âYou donât know what youâre talking about!â cried Humpty Dumpty. âHow
many days are there in a year?â

âThree hundred and sixty-five,â said Alice.

âAnd how many birthdays have you?â

âOne.â

âAnd if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains?â

âThree hundred and sixty-four, of course.â

Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. âIâd rather see that done on paper,â he
said.

Alice couldnât help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and
worked the sum for him:

 365
    1
____
364
___


Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. âThat seems to
be done rightââ he began.

âYouâre holding it upside down!â Alice interrupted.

âTo be sure I was!â Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round
for him. âI thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, that
_seems_ to be done rightâthough I havenât time to look it over
thoroughly just nowâand that shows that there are three hundred and
sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presentsââ

âCertainly,â said Alice.

âAnd only _one_ for birthday presents, you know. Thereâs glory for
you!â

âI donât know what you mean by âglory,ââ Alice said.

Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. âOf course you donâtâtill I tell
you. I meant âthereâs a nice knock-down argument for you!ââ

âBut âgloryâ doesnât mean âa nice knock-down argument,ââ Alice
objected.

âWhen _I_ use a word,â Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone,
âit means just what I choose it to meanâneither more nor less.â

âThe question is,â said Alice, âwhether you _can_ make words mean so
many different things.â

âThe question is,â said Humpty Dumpty, âwhich is to be masterâthatâs
all.â

Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty
Dumpty began again. âTheyâve a temper, some of themâparticularly verbs,
theyâre the proudestâadjectives you can do anything with, but not
verbsâhowever, _I_ can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability!
Thatâs what _I_ say!â

âWould you tell me, please,â said Alice âwhat that means?â

âNow you talk like a reasonable child,â said Humpty Dumpty, looking
very much pleased. âI meant by âimpenetrabilityâ that weâve had enough
of that subject, and it would be just as well if youâd mention what you
mean to do next, as I suppose you donât mean to stop here all the rest
of your life.â

âThatâs a great deal to make one word mean,â Alice said in a thoughtful
tone.

âWhen I make a word do a lot of work like that,â said Humpty Dumpty, âI
always pay it extra.â

âOh!â said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.

âAh, you should see âem come round me of a Saturday night,â Humpty
Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: âfor to get
their wages, you know.â

(Alice didnât venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I
canât tell _you_.)

âYou seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,â said Alice. âWould you
kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called âJabberwockyâ?â

âLetâs hear it,â said Humpty Dumpty. âI can explain all the poems that
were ever inventedâand a good many that havenât been invented just
yet.â

This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:

âTwas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe.


âThatâs enough to begin with,â Humpty Dumpty interrupted: âthere are
plenty of hard words there. â_Brillig_â means four oâclock in the
afternoonâthe time when you begin _broiling_ things for dinner.â

âThatâll do very well,â said Alice: âand â_slithy_â?â

âWell, â_slithy_â means âlithe and slimy.â âLitheâ is the same as
âactive.â You see itâs like a portmanteauâthere are two meanings packed
up into one word.â

âI see it now,â Alice remarked thoughtfully: âand what are â_toves_â?â

âWell, â_toves_â are something like badgersâtheyâre something like
lizardsâand theyâre something like corkscrews.â

âThey must be very curious looking creatures.â

âThey are that,â said Humpty Dumpty: âalso they make their nests under
sun-dialsâalso they live on cheese.â

âAnd whatâs the â_gyre_â and to â_gimble_â?â

âTo â_gyre_â is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To â_gimble_â
is to make holes like a gimlet.â

âAnd â_the wabe_â is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?â said
Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.

âOf course it is. Itâs called â_wabe_,â you know, because it goes a
long way before it, and a long way behind itââ

âAnd a long way beyond it on each side,â Alice added.

âExactly so. Well, then, â_mimsy_â is âflimsy and miserableâ (thereâs
another portmanteau for you). And a â_borogove_â is a thin
shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all roundâsomething
like a live mop.â

âAnd then â_mome raths_â?â said Alice. âIâm afraid Iâm giving you a
great deal of trouble.â

âWell, a â_rath_â is a sort of green pig: but â_mome_â Iâm not certain
about. I think itâs short for âfrom homeââmeaning that theyâd lost
their way, you know.â

âAnd what does â_outgrabe_â mean?â

âWell, â_outgrabing_â is something between bellowing and whistling,
with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, youâll hear it done,
maybeâdown in the wood yonderâand when youâve once heard it youâll be
_quite_ content. Whoâs been repeating all that hard stuff to you?â

âI read it in a book,â said Alice. âBut I had some poetry repeated to
me, much easier than that, byâTweedledee, I think it was.â

âAs to poetry, you know,â said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his
great hands, â_I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes
to thatââ

âOh, it neednât come to that!â Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him
from beginning.

âThe piece Iâm going to repeat,â he went on without noticing her
remark, âwas written entirely for your amusement.â

Alice felt that in that case she really _ought_ to listen to it, so she
sat down, and said âThank youâ rather sadly.

âIn winter, when the fields are white,
I sing this song for your delightâ


only I donât sing it,â he added, as an explanation.

âI see you donât,â said Alice.

âIf you can _see_ whether Iâm singing or not, youâve sharper eyes than
most.â Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was silent.

âIn spring, when woods are getting green,
Iâll try and tell you what I mean.â


âThank you very much,â said Alice.

âIn summer, when the days are long,
Perhaps youâll understand the song:

In autumn, when the leaves are brown,
Take pen and ink, and write it down.â


âI will, if I can remember it so long,â said Alice.

âYou neednât go on making remarks like that,â Humpty Dumpty said:
âtheyâre not sensible, and they put me out.â

âI sent a message to the fish:
I told them âThis is what I wish.â

The little fishes of the sea,
They sent an answer back to me.

The little fishesâ answer was
âWe cannot do it, Sir, becauseâââ


âIâm afraid I donât quite understand,â said Alice.

âIt gets easier further on,â Humpty Dumpty replied.

âI sent to them again to say
âIt will be better to obey.â

The fishes answered with a grin,
âWhy, what a temper you are in!â

I told them once, I told them twice:
They would not listen to advice.

I took a kettle large and new,
Fit for the deed I had to do.

My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
I filled the kettle at the pump.

Then some one came to me and said,
âThe little fishes are in bed.â

I said to him, I said it plain,
âThen you must wake them up again.â

I said it very loud and clear;
I went and shouted in his ear.â


Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this
verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, âI wouldnât have been the
messenger for _anything_!â

âBut he was very stiff and proud;
He said âYou neednât shout so loud!â

And he was very proud and stiff;
He said âIâd go and wake them, ifââ

I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
I went to wake them up myself.

And when I found the door was locked,
I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.

And when I found the door was shut,
I tried to turn the handle, butââ


There was a long pause.

âIs that all?â Alice timidly asked.

âThatâs all,â said Humpty Dumpty. âGood-bye.â

This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a _very_ strong
hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil
to stay. So she got up, and held out her hand. âGood-bye, till we meet
again!â she said as cheerfully as she could.

âI shouldnât know you again if we _did_ meet,â Humpty Dumpty replied in
a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; âyouâre so
exactly like other people.â

âThe face is what one goes by, generally,â Alice remarked in a
thoughtful tone.

âThatâs just what I complain of,â said Humpty Dumpty. âYour face is the
same as everybody hasâthe two eyes, soââ (marking their places in the
air with this thumb) ânose in the middle, mouth under. Itâs always the
same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for
instanceâor the mouth at the topâthat would be _some_ help.â

âIt wouldnât look nice,â Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty only shut
his eyes and said âWait till youâve tried.â

Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never
opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said âGood-bye!â
once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but
she couldnât help saying to herself as she went, âOf all the
unsatisfactoryââ (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) âof all the unsatisfactory people I
_ever_ metââ She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a
heavy crash shook the forest from end to end.




CHAPTER VII.
The Lion and the Unicorn


The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in
twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such
crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a
tree, for fear of being run over, and watched them go by.

She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him,
so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.

Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed rather better
than the foot-soldiers: but even _they_ stumbled now and then; and it
seemed to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider
fell off instantly. The confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was
very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found
the White King seated on the ground, busily writing in his
memorandum-book.

âIâve sent them all!â the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeing
Alice. âDid you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came
through the wood?â

âYes, I did,â said Alice: âseveral thousand, I should think.â

âFour thousand two hundred and seven, thatâs the exact number,â the
King said, referring to his book. âI couldnât send all the horses, you
know, because two of them are wanted in the game. And I havenât sent
the two Messengers, either. Theyâre both gone to the town. Just look
along the road, and tell me if you can see either of them.â

âI see nobody on the road,â said Alice.

âI only wish _I_ had such eyes,â the King remarked in a fretful tone.
âTo be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why, itâs as much
as _I_ can do to see real people, by this light!â

All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along the
road, shading her eyes with one hand. âI see somebody now!â she
exclaimed at last. âBut heâs coming very slowlyâand what curious
attitudes he goes into!â (For the messenger kept skipping up and down,
and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands
spread out like fans on each side.)

âNot at all,â said the King. âHeâs an Anglo-Saxon Messengerâand those
are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when heâs happy. His name
is Haigha.â (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with âmayor.â)

âI love my love with an H,â Alice couldnât help beginning, âbecause he
is Happy. I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous. I fed him
withâwithâwith Ham-sandwiches and Hay. His name is Haigha, and he
livesââ

âHe lives on the Hill,â the King remarked simply, without the least
idea that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating
for the name of a town beginning with H. âThe other Messengerâs called
Hatta. I must have _two_, you knowâto come and go. One to come, and one
to go.â

âI beg your pardon?â said Alice.

âIt isnât respectable to beg,â said the King.

âI only meant that I didnât understand,â said Alice. âWhy one to come
and one to go?â

âDidnât I tell you?â the King repeated impatiently. âI must have
_two_âto fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to carry.â

At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath
to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most
fearful faces at the poor King.

âThis young lady loves you with an H,â the King said, introducing Alice
in the hope of turning off the Messengerâs attention from himselfâbut
it was no useâthe Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary
every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.

âYou alarm me!â said the King. âI feel faintâGive me a ham sandwich!â

On which the Messenger, to Aliceâs great amusement, opened a bag that
hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it
greedily.

âAnother sandwich!â said the King.

âThereâs nothing but hay left now,â the Messenger said, peeping into
the bag.

âHay, then,â the King murmured in a faint whisper.

Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. âThereâs nothing
like eating hay when youâre faint,â he remarked to her, as he munched
away.

âI should think throwing cold water over you would be better,â Alice
suggested: âor some sal-volatile.â

âI didnât say there was nothing _better_,â the King replied. âI said
there was nothing _like_ it.â Which Alice did not venture to deny.

âWho did you pass on the road?â the King went on, holding out his hand
to the Messenger for some more hay.

âNobody,â said the Messenger.

âQuite right,â said the King: âthis young lady saw him too. So of
course Nobody walks slower than you.â

âI do my best,â the Messenger said in a sulky tone. âIâm sure nobody
walks much faster than I do!â

âHe canât do that,â said the King, âor else heâd have been here first.
However, now youâve got your breath, you may tell us whatâs happened in
the town.â

âIâll whisper it,â said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouth
in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the
Kingâs ear. Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news
too. However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of
his voice âTheyâre at it again!â

âDo you call _that_ a whisper?â cried the poor King, jumping up and
shaking himself. âIf you do such a thing again, Iâll have you buttered!
It went through and through my head like an earthquake!â

âIt would have to be a very tiny earthquake!â thought Alice. âWho are
at it again?â she ventured to ask.

âWhy the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,â said the King.

âFighting for the crown?â

âYes, to be sure,â said the King: âand the best of the joke is, that
itâs _my_ crown all the while! Letâs run and see them.â And they
trotted off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the
old song:â

âThe Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:
The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.
Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;
Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.â


âDoesâthe oneâthat winsâget the crown?â she asked, as well as she
could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.

âDear me, no!â said the King. âWhat an idea!â

âWould youâbe good enough,â Alice panted out, after running a little
further, âto stop a minuteâjust to getâoneâs breath again?â

âIâm _good_ enough,â the King said, âonly Iâm not strong enough. You
see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try to stop
a Bandersnatch!â

Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,
till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the
Lion and Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that
at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.

They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was
standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other.

âHeâs only just out of prison, and he hadnât finished his tea when he
was sent in,â Haigha whispered to Alice: âand they only give them
oyster-shells in thereâso you see heâs very hungry and thirsty. How are
you, dear child?â he went on, putting his arm affectionately round
Hattaâs neck.

Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.

âWere you happy in prison, dear child?â said Haigha.

Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down
his cheek: but not a word would he say.

âSpeak, canât you!â Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only munched
away, and drank some more tea.

âSpeak, wonât you!â cried the King. âHow are they getting on with the
fight?â

Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter. âTheyâre getting on very well,â he said in a choking
voice: âeach of them has been down about eighty-seven times.â

âThen I suppose theyâll soon bring the white bread and the brown?â
Alice ventured to remark.

âItâs waiting for âem now,â said Hatta: âthis is a bit of it as Iâm
eating.â

There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn
sat down, panting, while the King called out âTen minutes allowed for
refreshments!â Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste, but it was
_very_ dry.

âI donât think theyâll fight any more to-day,â the King said to Hatta:
âgo and order the drums to begin.â And Hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.

For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenly she
brightened up. âLook, look!â she cried, pointing eagerly. âThereâs the
White Queen running across the country! She came flying out of the wood
over yonderâHow fast those Queens _can_ run!â

âThereâs some enemy after her, no doubt,â the King said, without even
looking round. âThat woodâs full of them.â

âBut arenât you going to run and help her?â Alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly.

âNo use, no use!â said the King. âShe runs so fearfully quick. You
might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But Iâll make a memorandum
about her, if you likeâSheâs a dear good creature,â he repeated softly
to himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. âDo you spell âcreatureâ
with a double âeâ?â

At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets. âI had the best of it this time?â he said to the King, just
glancing at him as he passed.

âA littleâa little,â the King replied, rather nervously. âYou shouldnât
have run him through with your horn, you know.â

âIt didnât hurt him,â the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on,
when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust.

âWhatâisâthis?â he said at last.

âThis is a child!â Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice to
introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
Anglo-Saxon attitude. âWe only found it to-day. Itâs as large as life,
and twice as natural!â

âI always thought they were fabulous monsters!â said the Unicorn. âIs
it alive?â

âIt can talk,â said Haigha, solemnly.

The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said âTalk, child.â

Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: âDo
you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! I
never saw one alive before!â

âWell, now that we _have_ seen each other,â said the Unicorn, âif
youâll believe in me, Iâll believe in you. Is that a bargain?â

âYes, if you like,â said Alice.

âCome, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!â the Unicorn went on, turning
from her to the King. âNone of your brown bread for me!â

âCertainlyâcertainly!â the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha. âOpen
the bag!â he whispered. âQuick! Not that oneâthatâs full of hay!â

Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold,
while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it
Alice couldnât guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.

The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very tired
and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. âWhatâs this!â he said,
blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell.

âAh, what _is_ it, now?â the Unicorn cried eagerly. âYouâll never
guess! _I_ couldnât.â

The Lion looked at Alice wearily. âAre you animalâvegetableâor
mineral?â he said, yawning at every other word.

âItâs a fabulous monster!â the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could
reply.

âThen hand round the plum-cake, Monster,â the Lion said, lying down and
putting his chin on his paws. âAnd sit down, both of you,â (to the King
and the Unicorn): âfair play with the cake, you know!â

The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.

âWhat a fight we might have for the crown, _now_!â the Unicorn said,
looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking
off his head, he trembled so much.

âI should win easy,â said the Lion.

âIâm not so sure of that,â said the Unicorn.

âWhy, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!â the Lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke.

Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered. âAll round the town?â he said.
âThatâs a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge, or the
market-place? You get the best view by the old bridge.â

âIâm sure I donât know,â the Lion growled out as he lay down again.
âThere was too much dust to see anything. What a time the Monster is,
cutting up that cake!â

Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. âItâs
very provoking!â she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite
used to being called âthe Monsterâ). âIâve cut several slices already,
but they always join on again!â

âYou donât know how to manage Looking-glass cakes,â the Unicorn
remarked. âHand it round first, and cut it afterwards.â

This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried
the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she
did so. â_Now_ cut it up,â said the Lion, as she returned to her place
with the empty dish.

âI say, this isnât fair!â cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the
knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. âThe Monster has
given the Lion twice as much as me!â

âSheâs kept none for herself, anyhow,â said the Lion. âDo you like
plum-cake, Monster?â

But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.

Where the noise came from, she couldnât make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened. She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she
dropped to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to
shut out the dreadful uproar.

âIf _that_ doesnât âdrum them out of town,ââ she thought to herself,
ânothing ever will!â



CHAPTER VIII.
âItâs my own Inventionâ


After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead
silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one
to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers.
However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake, âSo I wasnât dreaming, after all,â she
said to herself, âunlessâunless weâre all part of the same dream. Only
I do hope itâs _my_ dream, and not the Red Kingâs! I donât like
belonging to another personâs dream,â she went on in a rather
complaining tone: âIâve a great mind to go and wake him, and see what
happens!â

At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
âAhoy! Ahoy! Check!â and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly: âYouâre my prisoner!â the Knight
cried, as he tumbled off his horse.

Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.
As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more âYouâre
myââ but here another voice broke in âAhoy! Ahoy! Check!â and Alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.

This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Aliceâs side, and
tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on
again, and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time
without speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some
bewilderment.

âSheâs _my_ prisoner, you know!â the Red Knight said at last.

âYes, but then _I_ came and rescued her!â the White Knight replied.

âWell, we must fight for her, then,â said the Red Knight, as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of
a horseâs head), and put it on.

âYou will observe the Rules of Battle, of course?â the White Knight
remarked, putting on his helmet too.

âI always do,â said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows.

âI wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are,â she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: âone
Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off
his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himselfâand another Rule
seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were
Punch and JudyâWhat a noise they make when they tumble! Just like a
whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the
horses are! They let them get on and off them just as if they were
tables!â

Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they
shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off.

âIt was a glorious victory, wasnât it?â said the White Knight, as he
came up panting.

âI donât know,â Alice said doubtfully. âI donât want to be anybodyâs
prisoner. I want to be a Queen.â

âSo you will, when youâve crossed the next brook,â said the White
Knight. âIâll see you safe to the end of the woodâand then I must go
back, you know. Thatâs the end of my move.â

âThank you very much,â said Alice. âMay I help you off with your
helmet?â It was evidently more than he could manage by himself;
however, she managed to shake him out of it at last.

âNow one can breathe more easily,â said the Knight, putting back his
shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild
eyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking
soldier in all her life.

He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and
he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder,
upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with
great curiosity.

âI see youâre admiring my little box.â the Knight said in a friendly
tone. âItâs my own inventionâto keep clothes and sandwiches in. You see
I carry it upside-down, so that the rain canât get in.â

âBut the things can get _out_,â Alice gently remarked. âDo you know the
lidâs open?â

âI didnât know it,â the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over
his face. âThen all the things must have fallen out! And the box is no
use without them.â He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to
throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,
and he hung it carefully on a tree. âCan you guess why I did that?â he
said to Alice.

Alice shook her head.

âIn hopes some bees may make a nest in itâthen I should get the honey.â

âBut youâve got a bee-hiveâor something like oneâfastened to the
saddle,â said Alice.

âYes, itâs a very good bee-hive,â the Knight said in a discontented
tone, âone of the best kind. But not a single bee has come near it yet.
And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the bees
outâor the bees keep the mice out, I donât know which.â

âI was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,â said Alice. âIt isnât
very likely there would be any mice on the horseâs back.â

âNot very likely, perhaps,â said the Knight: âbut if they _do_ come, I
donât choose to have them running all about.â

âYou see,â he went on after a pause, âitâs as well to be provided for
_everything_. Thatâs the reason the horse has all those anklets round
his feet.â

âBut what are they for?â Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

âTo guard against the bites of sharks,â the Knight replied. âItâs an
invention of my own. And now help me on. Iâll go with you to the end of
the woodâWhatâs the dish for?â

âItâs meant for plum-cake,â said Alice.

âWeâd better take it with us,â the Knight said. âItâll come in handy if
we find any plum-cake. Help me to get it into this bag.â

This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open
very carefully, because the Knight was so _very_ awkward in putting in
the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself
instead. âItâs rather a tight fit, you see,â he said, as they got it in
a last; âThere are so many candlesticks in the bag.â And he hung it to
the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and
fire-irons, and many other things.

âI hope youâve got your hair well fastened on?â he continued, as they
set off.

âOnly in the usual way,â Alice said, smiling.

âThatâs hardly enough,â he said, anxiously. âYou see the wind is so
_very_ strong here. Itâs as strong as soup.â

âHave you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?â
Alice enquired.

âNot yet,â said the Knight. âBut Iâve got a plan for keeping it from
_falling_ off.â

âI should like to hear it, very much.â

âFirst you take an upright stick,â said the Knight. âThen you make your
hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. Now the reason hair falls off is
because it hangs _down_âthings never fall _upwards_, you know. Itâs a
plan of my own invention. You may try it if you like.â

It didnât sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few
minutes she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now
and then stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was _not_ a
good rider.

Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in
front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather
suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except
that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he
generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon
found that it was the best plan not to walk _quite_ close to the horse.

âIâm afraid youâve not had much practice in riding,â she ventured to
say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.

The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the
remark. âWhat makes you say that?â he asked, as he scrambled back into
the saddle, keeping hold of Aliceâs hair with one hand, to save himself
from falling over on the other side.

âBecause people donât fall off quite so often, when theyâve had much
practice.â

âIâve had plenty of practice,â the Knight said very gravely: âplenty of
practice!â

Alice could think of nothing better to say than âIndeed?â but she said
it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after
this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice
watching anxiously for the next tumble.

âThe great art of riding,â the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice,
waving his right arm as he spoke, âis to keepââ Here the sentence ended
as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of
his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite
frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him
up, âI hope no bones are broken?â

âNone to speak of,â the Knight said, as if he didnât mind breaking two
or three of them. âThe great art of riding, as I was saying, isâto keep
your balance properly. Like this, you knowââ

He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice
what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the
horseâs feet.

âPlenty of practice!â he went on repeating, all the time that Alice was
getting him on his feet again. âPlenty of practice!â

âItâs too ridiculous!â cried Alice, losing all her patience this time.
âYou ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!â

âDoes that kind go smoothly?â the Knight asked in a tone of great
interest, clasping his arms round the horseâs neck as he spoke, just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again.

âMuch more smoothly than a live horse,â Alice said, with a little
scream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.

âIâll get one,â the Knight said thoughtfully to himself. âOne or
twoâseveral.â

There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on
again. âIâm a great hand at inventing things. Now, I daresay you
noticed, that last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather
thoughtful?â

âYou _were_ a little grave,â said Alice.

âWell, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gateâwould
you like to hear it?â

âVery much indeed,â Alice said politely.

âIâll tell you how I came to think of it,â said the Knight. âYou see, I
said to myself, âThe only difficulty is with the feet: the _head_ is
high enough already.â Now, first I put my head on the top of the
gateâthen I stand on my headâthen the feet are high enough, you
seeâthen Iâm over, you see.â

âYes, I suppose youâd be over when that was done,â Alice said
thoughtfully: âbut donât you think it would be rather hard?â

âI havenât tried it yet,â the Knight said, gravely: âso I canât tell
for certainâbut Iâm afraid it _would_ be a little hard.â

He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily.
âWhat a curious helmet youâve got!â she said cheerfully. âIs that your
invention too?â

The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the
saddle. âYes,â he said, âbut Iâve invented a better one than thatâlike
a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it
always touched the ground directly. So I had a _very_ little way to
fall, you seeâBut there _was_ the danger of falling _into_ it, to be
sure. That happened to me onceâand the worst of it was, before I could
get out again, the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it
was his own helmet.â

The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh.
âIâm afraid you must have hurt him,â she said in a trembling voice,
âbeing on the top of his head.â

âI had to kick him, of course,â the Knight said, very seriously. âAnd
then he took the helmet off againâbut it took hours and hours to get me
out. I was as fast asâas lightning, you know.â

âBut thatâs a different kind of fastness,â Alice objected.

The Knight shook his head. âIt was all kinds of fastness with me, I can
assure you!â he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said
this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a
deep ditch.

Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather
startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and
she was afraid that he really _was_ hurt this time. However, though she
could see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to
hear that he was talking on in his usual tone. âAll kinds of fastness,â
he repeated: âbut it was careless of him to put another manâs helmet
onâwith the man in it, too.â

âHow _can_ you go on talking so quietly, head downwards?â Alice asked,
as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.

The Knight looked surprised at the question. âWhat does it matter where
my body happens to be?â he said. âMy mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new
things.â

âNow the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did,â he went on after
a pause, âwas inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.â

âIn time to have it cooked for the next course?â said Alice. âWell, not
the _next_ course,â the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: âno,
certainly not the next _course_.â

âThen it would have to be the next day. I suppose you wouldnât have two
pudding-courses in one dinner?â

âWell, not the _next_ day,â the Knight repeated as before: ânot the
next _day_. In fact,â he went on, holding his head down, and his voice
getting lower and lower, âI donât believe that pudding ever _was_
cooked! In fact, I donât believe that pudding ever _will_ be cooked!
And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.â

âWhat did you mean it to be made of?â Alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.

âIt began with blotting paper,â the Knight answered with a groan.

âThat wouldnât be very nice, Iâm afraidââ

âNot very nice _alone_,â he interrupted, quite eagerly: âbut youâve no
idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other thingsâsuch as
gunpowder and sealing-wax. And here I must leave you.â They had just
come to the end of the wood.

Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.

âYou are sad,â the Knight said in an anxious tone: âlet me sing you a
song to comfort you.â

âIs it very long?â Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry
that day.

âItâs long,â said the Knight, âbut very, _very_ beautiful. Everybody
that hears me sing itâeither it brings the _tears_ into their eyes, or
elseââ

âOr else what?â said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.

âOr else it doesnât, you know. The name of the song is called
â_Haddocksâ Eyes_.ââ

âOh, thatâs the name of the song, is it?â Alice said, trying to feel
interested.

âNo, you donât understand,â the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
âThatâs what the name is _called_. The name really _is_ â_The Aged Aged
Man_.ââ

âThen I ought to have said âThatâs what the _song_ is calledâ?â Alice
corrected herself.

âNo, you oughtnât: thatâs quite another thing! The _song_ is called
â_Ways and Means_â: but thatâs only what itâs _called_, you know!â

âWell, what _is_ the song, then?â said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered.

âI was coming to that,â the Knight said. âThe song really _is_
â_A-sitting On A Gate_â: and the tuneâs my own invention.â

So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile
lighting up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his
song, he began.

Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The
Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most
clearly. Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again,
as if it had been only yesterdayâthe mild blue eyes and kindly smile of
the Knightâthe setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on
his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled herâthe horse quietly
moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the
grass at her feetâand the black shadows of the forest behindâall this
she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she
leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a
half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.

âBut the tune _isnât_ his own invention,â she said to herself: âitâs
â_I give thee all, I can no more_.ââ She stood and listened very
attentively, but no tears came into her eyes.

âIâll tell thee everything I can;
    Thereâs little to relate.
I saw an aged aged man,
    A-sitting on a gate.
âWho are you, aged man?â I said,
    âand how is it you live?â
And his answer trickled through my head
    Like water through a sieve.

He said âI look for butterflies
    That sleep among the wheat:
I make them into mutton-pies,
    And sell them in the street.
I sell them unto men,â he said,
    âWho sail on stormy seas;
And thatâs the way I get my breadâ
    A trifle, if you please.â

But I was thinking of a plan
    To dye oneâs whiskers green,
And always use so large a fan
    That they could not be seen.
So, having no reply to give
    To what the old man said,
I cried, âCome, tell me how you live!â
    And thumped him on the head.

His accents mild took up the tale:
    He said âI go my ways,
And when I find a mountain-rill,
    I set it in a blaze;
And thence they make a stuff they call
    Rolandsâ Macassar Oilâ
Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
    They give me for my toil.â

But I was thinking of a way
    To feed oneself on batter,
And so go on from day to day
    Getting a little fatter.
I shook him well from side to side,
    Until his face was blue:
âCome, tell me how you live,â I cried,
    âAnd what it is you do!â

He said âI hunt for haddocksâ eyes
    Among the heather bright,
And work them into waistcoat-buttons
    In the silent night.
And these I do not sell for gold
    Or coin of silvery shine
But for a copper halfpenny,
    And that will purchase nine.

âI sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
    Or set limed twigs for crabs;
I sometimes search the grassy knolls
    For wheels of Hansom-cabs.
And thatâs the wayâ (he gave a wink)
    âBy which I get my wealthâ
And very gladly will I drink
    Your Honourâs noble health.â

I heard him then, for I had just
    Completed my design
To keep the Menai bridge from rust
    By boiling it in wine.
I thanked him much for telling me
    The way he got his wealth,
But chiefly for his wish that he
    Might drink my noble health.

And now, if eâer by chance I put
    My fingers into glue
Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
    Into a left-hand shoe,
Or if I drop upon my toe
    A very heavy weight,
I weep, for it reminds me so,
Of that old man I used to knowâ
Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
Whose face was very like a crow,
With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
Who seemed distracted with his woe,
Who rocked his body to and fro,
And muttered mumblingly and low,
As if his mouth were full of dough,
Who snorted like a buffaloâ
That summer evening, long ago,
    A-sitting on a gate.â


As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the
reins, and turned his horseâs head along the road by which they had
come. âYouâve only a few yards to go,â he said, âdown the hill and over
that little brook, and then youâll be a QueenâBut youâll stay and see
me off first?â he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed. âI shanât be long. Youâll wait and wave
your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road? I think itâll
encourage me, you see.â

âOf course Iâll wait,â said Alice: âand thank you very much for coming
so farâand for the songâI liked it very much.â

âI hope so,â the Knight said doubtfully: âbut you didnât cry so much as
I thought you would.â

So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the
forest. âIt wonât take long to see him _off_, I expect,â Alice said to
herself, as she stood watching him. âThere he goes! Right on his head
as usual! However, he gets on again pretty easilyâthat comes of having
so many things hung round the horseââ So she went on talking to
herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and
the Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After
the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her
handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight.

âI hope it encouraged him,â she said, as she turned to run down the
hill: âand now for the last brook, and to be a Queen! How grand it
sounds!â A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook. âThe
Eighth Square at last!â she cried as she bounded across,

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little
flower-beds dotted about it here and there. âOh, how glad I am to get
here! And what _is_ this on my head?â she exclaimed in a tone of
dismay, as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted
tight all round her head.

âBut how _can_ it have got there without my knowing it?â she said to
herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what
it could possibly be.

It was a golden crown.




CHAPTER IX.
Queen Alice


âWell, this _is_ grand!â said Alice. âI never expected I should be a
Queen so soonâand Iâll tell you what it is, your majesty,â she went on
in a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself),
âitâll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that!
Queens have to be dignified, you know!â

So she got up and walked aboutârather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with
the thought that there was nobody to see her, âand if I really am a
Queen,â she said as she sat down again, âI shall be able to manage it
quite well in time.â

Everything was happening so oddly that she didnât feel a bit surprised
at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. âPlease, would
you tell meââ she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.

âSpeak when youâre spoken to!â The Queen sharply interrupted her.

âBut if everybody obeyed that rule,â said Alice, who was always ready
for a little argument, âand if you only spoke when you were spoken to,
and the other person always waited for _you_ to begin, you see nobody
would ever say anything, so thatââ

âRidiculous!â cried the Queen. âWhy, donât you see, childââ here she
broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation. âWhat do you mean by âIf you
really are a Queenâ? What right have you to call yourself so? You canât
be a Queen, you know, till youâve passed the proper examination. And
the sooner we begin it, the better.â

âI only said âifâ!â poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone.

The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a
little shudder, âShe _says_ she only said âifâââ

âBut she said a great deal more than that!â the White Queen moaned,
wringing her hands. âOh, ever so much more than that!â

âSo you did, you know,â the Red Queen said to Alice. âAlways speak the
truthâthink before you speakâand write it down afterwards.â

âIâm sure I didnât meanââ Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen
interrupted her impatiently.

âThatâs just what I complain of! You _should_ have meant! What do you
suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even a joke should
have some meaningâand a childâs more important than a joke, I hope. You
couldnât deny that, even if you tried with both hands.â

âI donât deny things with my _hands_,â Alice objected.

âNobody said you did,â said the Red Queen. âI said you couldnât if you
tried.â

âSheâs in that state of mind,â said the White Queen, âthat she wants to
deny _something_âonly she doesnât know what to deny!â

âA nasty, vicious temper,â the Red Queen remarked; and then there was
an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.

The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, âI invite
you to Aliceâs dinner-party this afternoon.â

The White Queen smiled feebly, and said âAnd I invite _you_.â

âI didnât know I was to have a party at all,â said Alice; âbut if there
is to be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests.â

âWe gave you the opportunity of doing it,â the Red Queen remarked: âbut
I daresay youâve not had many lessons in manners yet?â

âManners are not taught in lessons,â said Alice. âLessons teach you to
do sums, and things of that sort.â

âAnd you do Addition?â the White Queen asked. âWhatâs one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?â

âI donât know,â said Alice. âI lost count.â

âShe canât do Addition,â the Red Queen interrupted. âCan you do
Subtraction? Take nine from eight.â

âNine from eight I canât, you know,â Alice replied very readily: âbutââ

âShe canât do Subtraction,â said the White Queen. âCan you do Division?
Divide a loaf by a knifeâwhatâs the answer to that?â

âI supposeââ Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her.
âBread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take a bone
from a dog: what remains?â

Alice considered. âThe bone wouldnât remain, of course, if I took
itâand the dog wouldnât remain; it would come to bite meâand Iâm sure
_I_ shouldnât remain!â

âThen you think nothing would remain?â said the Red Queen.

âI think thatâs the answer.â

âWrong, as usual,â said the Red Queen: âthe dogâs temper would remain.â

âBut I donât see howââ

âWhy, look here!â the Red Queen cried. âThe dog would lose its temper,
wouldnât it?â

âPerhaps it would,â Alice replied cautiously.

âThen if the dog went away, its temper would remain!â the Queen
exclaimed triumphantly.

Alice said, as gravely as she could, âThey might go different ways.â
But she couldnât help thinking to herself, âWhat dreadful nonsense we
_are_ talking!â

âShe canât do sums a _bit_!â the Queens said together, with great
emphasis.

âCan _you_ do sums?â Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen,
for she didnât like being found fault with so much.

The Queen gasped and shut her eyes. âI can do Addition, if you give me
timeâbut I canât do Subtraction, under _any_ circumstances!â

âOf course you know your A B C?â said the Red Queen.

âTo be sure I do.â said Alice.

âSo do I,â the White Queen whispered: âweâll often say it over
together, dear. And Iâll tell you a secretâI can read words of one
letter! Isnât _that_ grand! However, donât be discouraged. Youâll come
to it in time.â

Here the Red Queen began again. âCan you answer useful questions?â she
said. âHow is bread made?â

âI know _that_!â Alice cried eagerly. âYou take some flourââ

âWhere do you pick the flower?â the White Queen asked. âIn a garden, or
in the hedges?â

âWell, it isnât _picked_ at all,â Alice explained: âitâs _ground_ââ

âHow many acres of ground?â said the White Queen. âYou mustnât leave
out so many things.â

âFan her head!â the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. âSheâll be
feverish after so much thinking.â So they set to work and fanned her
with bunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew
her hair about so.

âSheâs all right again now,â said the Red Queen. âDo you know
Languages? Whatâs the French for fiddle-de-dee?â

âFiddle-de-deeâs not English,â Alice replied gravely.

âWho ever said it was?â said the Red Queen.

Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. âIf youâll
tell me what language âfiddle-de-deeâ is, Iâll tell you the French for
it!â she exclaimed triumphantly.

But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said âQueens
never make bargains.â

âI wish Queens never asked questions,â Alice thought to herself.

âDonât let us quarrel,â the White Queen said in an anxious tone. âWhat
is the cause of lightning?â

âThe cause of lightning,â Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this, âis the thunderâno, no!â she hastily corrected
herself. âI meant the other way.â

âItâs too late to correct it,â said the Red Queen: âwhen youâve once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.â

âWhich reminds meââ the White Queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands, âwe had _such_ a thunderstorm last
TuesdayâI mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know.â

Alice was puzzled. âIn _our_ country,â she remarked, âthereâs only one
day at a time.â

The Red Queen said, âThatâs a poor thin way of doing things. Now
_here_, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and
sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights togetherâfor
warmth, you know.â

âAre five nights warmer than one night, then?â Alice ventured to ask.

âFive times as warm, of course.â

âBut they should be five times as _cold_, by the same ruleââ

âJust so!â cried the Red Queen. âFive times as warm, _and_ five times
as coldâjust as Iâm five times as rich as you are, _and_ five times as
clever!â

Alice sighed and gave it up. âItâs exactly like a riddle with no
answer!â she thought.

âHumpty Dumpty saw it too,â the White Queen went on in a low voice,
more as if she were talking to herself. âHe came to the door with a
corkscrew in his handââ

âWhat did he want?â said the Red Queen.

âHe said he _would_ come in,â the White Queen went on, âbecause he was
looking for a hippopotamus. Now, as it happened, there wasnât such a
thing in the house, that morning.â

âIs there generally?â Alice asked in an astonished tone.

âWell, only on Thursdays,â said the Queen.

âI know what he came for,â said Alice: âhe wanted to punish the fish,
becauseââ

Here the White Queen began again. âIt was _such_ a thunderstorm, you
canât think!â (âShe _never_ could, you know,â said the Red Queen.) âAnd
part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got inâand it went
rolling round the room in great lumpsâand knocking over the tables and
thingsâtill I was so frightened, I couldnât remember my own name!â

Alice thought to herself, âI never should _try_ to remember my name in
the middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it?â but she did
not say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queenâs feeling.

âYour Majesty must excuse her,â the Red Queen said to Alice, taking one
of the White Queenâs hands in her own, and gently stroking it: âshe
means well, but she canât help saying foolish things, as a general
rule.â

The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she _ought_ to say
something kind, but really couldnât think of anything at the moment.

âShe never was really well brought up,â the Red Queen went on: âbut
itâs amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how
pleased sheâll be!â But this was more than Alice had courage to do.

âA little kindnessâand putting her hair in papersâwould do wonders with
herââ

The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Aliceâs
shoulder. âI _am_ so sleepy?â she moaned.

âSheâs tired, poor thing!â said the Red Queen. âSmooth her hairâlend
her your nightcapâand sing her a soothing lullaby.â

âI havenât got a nightcap with me,â said Alice, as she tried to obey
the first direction: âand I donât know any soothing lullabies.â

âI must do it myself, then,â said the Red Queen, and she began:

âHush-a-by lady, in Aliceâs lap!
Till the feastâs ready, weâve time for a nap:
When the feastâs over, weâll go to the ballâ
Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!


âAnd now you know the words,â she added, as she put her head down on
Aliceâs other shoulder, âjust sing it through to _me_. Iâm getting
sleepy, too.â In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and
snoring loud.

âWhat _am_ I to do?â exclaimed Alice, looking about in great
perplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down
from her shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. âI donât think
it _ever_ happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens
asleep at once! No, not in all the History of Englandâit couldnât, you
know, because there never was more than one Queen at a time. Do wake
up, you heavy things!â she went on in an impatient tone; but there was
no answer but a gentle snoring.

The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a
tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so
eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she
hardly missed them.

She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a
bell-handle; one was marked âVisitorsâ Bell,â and the other âServantsâ
Bell.â

âIâll wait till the songâs over,â thought Alice, âand then Iâll
ringâtheâ_which_ bell must I ring?â she went on, very much puzzled by
the names. âIâm not a visitor, and Iâm not a servant. There _ought_ to
be one marked âQueen,â you knowââ

Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak
put its head out for a moment and said âNo admittance till the week
after next!â and shut the door again with a bang.

Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old
Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on.

âWhat is it, now?â the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.

Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. âWhereâs the
servant whose business it is to answer the door?â she began angrily.

âWhich door?â said the Frog.

Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke. â_This_ door, of course!â

The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then
he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying
whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.

âTo answer the door?â he said. âWhatâs it been asking of?â He was so
hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.

âI donât know what you mean,â she said.

âI talks English, doesnât I?â the Frog went on. âOr are you deaf? What
did it ask you?â

âNothing!â Alice said impatiently. âIâve been knocking at it!â

âShouldnât do thatâshouldnât do thatââ the Frog muttered. âVexes it,
you know.â Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet. âYou let _it_ alone,â he panted out, as he hobbled back to
his tree, âand itâll let _you_ alone, you know.â

At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing:

âTo the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,
âIâve a sceptre in hand, Iâve a crown on my head;
Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,
Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me.ââ


And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:

âThen fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the teaâ
And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!â


Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to
herself, âThirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any oneâs
counting?â In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;

ââO Looking-Glass creatures,â quoth Alice, âdraw near!
âTis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
âTis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!ââ


Then came the chorus again:â

âThen fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wineâ
And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!â


âNinety times nine!â Alice repeated in despair, âOh, thatâll never be
done! Iâd better go in at onceââ and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.

Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large
hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds:
some were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among
them. âIâm glad theyâve come without waiting to be asked,â she thought:
âI should never have known who were the right people to invite!â

There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White
Queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty.
Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing
for some one to speak.

At last the Red Queen began. âYouâve missed the soup and fish,â she
said. âPut on the joint!â And the waiters set a leg of mutton before
Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve
a joint before.

âYou look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,â
said the Red Queen. âAliceâMutton; MuttonâAlice.â The leg of mutton got
up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned the
bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.

âMay I give you a slice?â she said, taking up the knife and fork, and
looking from one Queen to the other.

âCertainly not,â the Red Queen said, very decidedly: âit isnât
etiquette to cut any one youâve been introduced to. Remove the joint!â
And the waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its
place.

âI wonât be introduced to the pudding, please,â Alice said rather
hastily, âor we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?â

But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled âPuddingâAlice;
AliceâPudding. Remove the pudding!â and the waiters took it away so
quickly that Alice couldnât return its bow.

However, she didnât see why the Red Queen should be the only one to
give orders, so, as an experiment, she called out âWaiter! Bring back
the pudding!â and there it was again in a moment like a
conjuring-trick. It was so large that she couldnât help feeling a
_little_ shy with it, as she had been with the mutton; however, she
conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it
to the Red Queen.

âWhat impertinence!â said the Pudding. âI wonder how youâd like it, if
I were to cut a slice out of _you_, you creature!â

It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadnât a word to
say in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.

âMake a remark,â said the Red Queen: âitâs ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding!â

âDo you know, Iâve had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me
to-day,â Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment
she opened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed
upon her; âand itâs a very curious thing, I thinkâevery poem was about
fishes in some way. Do you know why theyâre so fond of fishes, all
about here?â

She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.
âAs to fishes,â she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Aliceâs ear, âher White Majesty knows a lovely riddleâall in
poetryâall about fishes. Shall she repeat it?â

âHer Red Majestyâs very kind to mention it,â the White Queen murmured
into Aliceâs other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. âIt
would be _such_ a treat! May I?â

âPlease do,â Alice said very politely.

The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Aliceâs cheek. Then
she began:

    ââFirst, the fish must be caught.â
That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.
    âNext, the fish must be bought.â
That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.

    âNow cook me the fish!â
That is easy, and will not take more than a minute.
    âLet it lie in a dish!â
That is easy, because it already is in it.

    âBring it here! Let me sup!â
It is easy to set such a dish on the table.
    âTake the dish-cover up!â
Ah, that is so hard that I fear Iâm unable!

    For it holds it like glueâ
Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:
    Which is easiest to do,
Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?â


âTake a minute to think about it, and then guess,â said the Red Queen.
âMeanwhile, weâll drink your healthâQueen Aliceâs health!â she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
facesâothers upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off the
edges of the tableâand three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy, âjust like pigs in a trough!â thought Alice.

âYou ought to return thanks in a neat speech,â the Red Queen said,
frowning at Alice as she spoke.

âWe must support you, you know,â the White Queen whispered, as Alice
got up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.

âThank you very much,â she whispered in reply, âbut I can do quite well
without.â

âThat wouldnât be at all the thing,â the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.

(âAnd they _did_ push so!â she said afterwards, when she was telling
her sister the history of the feast. âYou would have thought they
wanted to squeeze me flat!â)

In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: âI rise to return thanksââ
Alice began: and she really _did_ rise as she spoke, several inches;
but she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself
down again.

âTake care of yourself!â screamed the White Queen, seizing Aliceâs hair
with both her hands. âSomethingâs going to happen!â

And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things
happened in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking
something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the
bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on
as wings, and so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all
directions: âand very like birds they look,â Alice thought to herself,
as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.

At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. âHere I am!â cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see
the Queenâs broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.

There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards Aliceâs chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way.

âI canât stand this any longer!â she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.

âAnd as for _you_,â she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen,
whom she considered as the cause of all the mischiefâbut the Queen was
no longer at her sideâshe had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.

At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything _now_. âAs for _you_,â
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, âIâll
shake you into a kitten, that I will!â




CHAPTER X.
Shaking


She took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might.

The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
shaking her, she kept on growing shorterâand fatterâand softerâand
rounderâandâ




CHAPTER XI.
Waking


âand it really _was_ a kitten, after all.




CHAPTER XII.
Which Dreamed it?


âYour majesty shouldnât purr so loud,â Alice said, rubbing her eyes,
and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. âYou
woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And youâve been along with me,
Kittyâall through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?â

It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they _always_ purr. âIf they
would only purr for âyesâ and mew for âno,â or any rule of that sort,â
she had said, âso that one could keep up a conversation! But how _can_
you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?â

On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant âyesâ or âno.â

So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. âNow, Kitty!â she
cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. âConfess that was what you
turned into!â

(âBut it wouldnât look at it,â she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister: âit turned away its head, and pretended
not to see it: but it looked a _little_ ashamed of itself, so I think
it _must_ have been the Red Queen.â)

âSit up a little more stiffly, dear!â Alice cried with a merry laugh.
âAnd curtsey while youâre thinking what toâwhat to purr. It saves time,
remember!â And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, âjust in
honour of having been a Red Queen.â

âSnowdrop, my pet!â she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, âwhen _will_
Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dreamâDinah! do you know that youâre
scrubbing a White Queen? Really, itâs most disrespectful of you!

âAnd what did _Dinah_ turn to, I wonder?â she prattled on, as she
settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in
her hand, to watch the kittens. âTell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty
Dumpty? I _think_ you didâhowever, youâd better not mention it to your
friends just yet, for Iâm not sure.

âBy the way, Kitty, if only youâd been really with me in my dream,
there was one thing you _would_ have enjoyedâI had such a quantity of
poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a
real treat. All the time youâre eating your breakfast, Iâll repeat âThe
Walrus and the Carpenterâ to you; and then you can make believe itâs
oysters, dear!

âNow, Kitty, letâs consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a
serious question, my dear, and you should _not_ go on licking your paw
like thatâas if Dinah hadnât washed you this morning! You see, Kitty,
it _must_ have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream,
of courseâbut then I was part of his dream, too! _Was_ it the Red King,
Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to knowâOh, Kitty, _do_
help to settle it! Iâm sure your paw can wait!â But the provoking
kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadnât heard the
question.

Which do _you_ think it was?


A boat beneath a sunny sky,
Lingering onward dreamily
In an evening of Julyâ

Children three that nestle near,
Eager eye and willing ear,
Pleased a simple tale to hearâ

Long has paled that sunny sky:
Echoes fade and memories die.
Autumn frosts have slain July.

Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
Alice moving under skies
Never seen by waking eyes.

Children yet, the tale to hear,
Eager eye and willing ear,
Lovingly shall nestle near.

In a Wonderland they lie,
Dreaming as the days go by,
Dreaming as the summers die:

Ever drifting down the streamâ
Lingering in the golden gleamâ
Life, what is it but a dream?

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenbergâ¢ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenbergâ¢
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain âDefects,â such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the âRight
of Replacement or Refundâ described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenbergâ¢ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenbergâ¢
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢

Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
